## 1.0 Scope

This document defines the Autonomous Development Loop for the ALETHEIA platform. It specifies the repeatable control cycle through which the platform transforms formal specifications into validated, traceable, repository-controlled, package-ready, and deployment-prepared software artifacts.

This document applies to autonomous construction runs, repair cycles, specification-change cycles, revalidation cycles, artifact regeneration cycles, package preparation cycles, and deployment preparation cycles.

This document defines:

* loop purpose and principles
* loop lifecycle states
* loop inputs and outputs
* loop stages
* stage gates
* reuse discovery and reuse-gated generation
* Construction Boundary and Connection Context controls
* iteration and termination rules
* convergence criteria
* repair and revalidation behavior
* change-driven re-entry
* packaging and deployment preparation gates
* governance controls
* state, traceability, evidence, and telemetry requirements
* loop error classes
* conformance requirements

---

## 2.0 Purpose

The purpose of the Autonomous Development Loop is to define the operational rhythm of ALETHEIA autonomous construction. The loop is the platform-level control cycle that coordinates interpretation, planning, generation, validation, repair, packaging, deployment preparation, and continuous evolution.

The loop is not merely a sequence of phases. It is a governed feedback system. Each iteration produces artifacts, evidence, validation results, state transitions, traceability links, telemetry, and decisions that determine whether the platform should proceed, repair, replan, package, prepare deployment, escalate, halt, or fail.

The Autonomous Development Loop exists to ensure that:

* specification intent drives construction
* construction plans become executable work
* applicable construction work performs reuse discovery before generation
* Construction Boundaries and Connection Contexts constrain model context and boundary crossing
* generated artifacts are validated before acceptance
* validation failures trigger bounded repair
* repair does not continue indefinitely
* convergence is evidence-based
* specification changes trigger targeted re-entry
* packaging occurs only after stable artifact convergence
* deployment preparation occurs only after packaging and governance conditions
* every loop decision is recorded, traceable, observable, and governable

---

## 3.0 Loop Design Principles

### 3.1 Specification-Driven Operation

The loop MUST begin from a versioned specification or a governed change to an existing specification. The loop MUST NOT begin from informal instructions, hidden context, or untracked implementation changes.

### 3.2 Evidence-Based Progression

A loop stage MUST NOT be considered complete unless required evidence exists. Evidence MAY include canonical model records, construction plans, task state, artifacts, validation results, repair records, traceability snapshots, governance decisions, or completion reports.

### 3.3 Validation Before Acceptance

Generated or modified artifacts MUST be validated before they are promoted to stable state. Agent or model assertion MUST NOT substitute for deterministic validation when deterministic validation is applicable.

### 3.4 Bounded Repair

Repair cycles MUST be bounded by configured repair limits. The loop MUST escalate or fail when repair limits are reached.

### 3.5 State-Controlled Continuation

The loop MUST use durable platform state to determine continuation. Telemetry, logs, or in-memory task status MUST NOT be the sole authority for loop progression.

### 3.6 Governance-Aware Autonomy

The loop MAY operate autonomously only within governance constraints. Governance decisions MUST be treated as loop control signals.

### 3.7 Targeted Re-Entry

When a specification changes, the loop SHOULD use traceability and impact analysis to identify affected tasks and artifacts. The platform SHOULD avoid full regeneration when targeted reconstruction is sufficient and governed.

### 3.8 Reuse Before Generation

The loop MUST prefer approved reusable assets over new generation when reuse is applicable. Artifact-producing work MUST NOT enter unconstrained generation until required Reuse Discovery and Reuse Decision Records exist.

### 3.9 Boundary-Controlled Context

The loop MUST execute tasks within their active Construction Boundary and MUST transfer context across boundaries only through valid Connection Contexts. Context packages SHOULD be minimized so local and resource-constrained model deployments can operate without inheriting unrelated construction history.

---

## 4.0 Loop Lifecycle States

The Autonomous Development Loop MUST maintain explicit lifecycle state.

| escalated            | Loop requires governance or human resolution                                           |
| halted               | Loop was stopped by policy, runtime, or operator decision                              |
| failed               | Loop ended because required criteria could not be satisfied                            |

## 8.0 Stage 1 — Specification Interpretation

Specification Interpretation converts the authored specification into canonical form.

This stage gives the loop a machine-interpretable source of truth. It ensures that later planning and generation operate from canonical entities and relationships rather than unstructured prose.

### 8.1 Required Inputs

* authored specification
* ISL syntax or representation schema
* canonical entity schemas
* identifier policy
* readiness target

### 8.2 Required Outputs

* parsed specification record
* canonical model record
* canonical entity records
* canonical relationship records
* canonical validation report
* specification-to-canonical traceability links

### 8.3 Completion Criteria

Specification Interpretation is complete only when:

* required specification metadata exists
* required sections and entities are parsed
* canonical model generation succeeds
* canonical validation has no blocking findings
* canonical model state is persisted
* traceability links from source specification to canonical entities exist

### 8.4 Failure Rules

A blocking parse error MUST fail or escalate the loop.

A blocking canonical validation error MUST prevent planning.

Unsupported specification content MUST be recorded as warning, rejection, or escalation according to the active governance profile.

---

## 9.0 Stage 2 — Construction Planning

Construction Planning converts the canonical model into an executable construction plan.

This stage determines what must be built, which tasks are required, how tasks depend on one another, which agents or tools are needed, and what artifacts are expected.

### 9.1 Required Inputs

* canonical model record
* readiness state
* governance constraints
* tool capability catalog
* agent role registry
* reusable asset registry
* active Construction Boundaries
* applicable Connection Contexts
* artifact policy
* traceability graph

### 9.2 Required Outputs

* construction plan record
* construction task graph
* task dependency records
* expected artifact declarations
* reuse discovery records where applicable
* reuse decision records where applicable
* boundary continuation records where applicable
* validation task declarations
* repair task declarations
* planning validation report

### 9.3 Completion Criteria

Construction Planning is complete only when:

* every required canonical entity is addressed by a task or justified exclusion
* task dependencies are valid
* required agent roles are available
* required tool capabilities are available
* expected artifacts are declared
* applicable Reuse Discovery has completed
* applicable Reuse Decision Records authorize full reuse, delta generation, wrapper, extension, composition, or new generation
* active Construction Boundaries and Connection Contexts are valid
* validation tasks are declared
* repair policy is attached
* planning validation passes

### 9.4 Failure Rules

A construction plan with unsatisfied dependencies MUST NOT become executable.

A construction plan missing required validation tasks MUST NOT become executable.

A plan requiring unavailable required tools or agents MUST be rejected, delayed, or escalated.

A construction plan missing required Reuse Discovery or Reuse Decision Records MUST NOT become executable.

A construction plan that requires boundary crossing without a valid Connection Context MUST NOT become executable.

---

## 10.0 Stage 3 — Reuse-Gated Runtime Execution and Artifact Generation

Runtime Execution performs the construction tasks that generate, modify, or prepare artifacts.

This stage is the main construction activity. Agents, models, tools, and repository services work under runtime orchestration to create candidate implementation artifacts, admit reused assets, or produce authorized deltas, wrappers, extensions, and compositions.

### 10.1 Required Inputs

* executable construction plan
* execution graph
* runtime configuration
* agent registry
* model routing policy
* reuse decision records
* selected reusable asset records where applicable
* active Construction Boundary
* Connection Contexts required for boundary crossing
* artifact repository workspace
* governance state
* traceability state

### 10.2 Required Outputs

* task execution records
* agent invocation records
* model invocation records when models are used
* candidate artifact records
* artifact content references
* reuse provenance records where applicable
* artifact admission records
* artifact state records
* runtime telemetry

### 10.3 Completion Criteria

Runtime Execution and Artifact Generation is complete only when:

* required artifact-producing tasks have completed
* full generation was not used when reuse, delta, wrapper, extension, or composition was authorized instead
* generated artifacts are admitted into repository working state
* artifacts include metadata
* reused or reuse-derived artifacts include reuse provenance metadata
* artifacts reference producing tasks and source entities
* model invocations remained within active Construction Boundary and authorized Connection Contexts
* task state is persisted
* generation-related traceability links exist

### 10.4 Failure Rules

A failed artifact-producing task MUST trigger retry, repair, escalation, or failure according to runtime policy.

An artifact candidate missing required metadata MUST be rejected.

An artifact produced outside repository admission MUST be quarantined or rejected.

An artifact generated contrary to a Reuse Decision Record MUST be rejected or routed to governance as a reuse exception.

Context drift outside the active Construction Boundary or authorized Connection Context MUST halt the affected task and trigger repair, replan, or escalation.

---

## 11.0 Stage 4 — Deterministic Validation

Deterministic Validation verifies artifacts using registered tools and defined validation criteria.

This stage is the inspection function of the loop. It determines whether generated artifacts satisfy structural, functional, security, policy, packaging, or deployment-readiness expectations.

### 11.1 Required Inputs

* pending or repaired artifacts
* validation tasks
* tool capability catalog
* validation profile
* artifact metadata
* governance policy

### 11.2 Required Outputs

* tool invocation records
* normalized tool results
* validation result records
* validation findings
* validation evidence
* artifact validation state updates
* validation-to-artifact traceability links

### 11.3 Required Validation Categories

The loop SHOULD support:

* compile or build validation
* unit test validation
* integration test validation where applicable
* static analysis where configured
* security scan where configured
* dependency audit where configured
* configuration validation where configured
* repository integrity validation
* traceability integrity validation

### 11.4 Completion Criteria

Validation is complete only when:

* required validation tasks have run
* validation outcomes are recorded
* validation evidence is retained
* artifact state reflects validation results
* failed validations are classified
* next action is determined for each failed validation

### 11.5 Failure Rules

A failed required validation MUST prevent artifact promotion unless a valid waiver exists.

A tool timeout MUST NOT be treated as success.

A missing validation result MUST block convergence.

A validation result without artifact version reference MUST be invalid.

---

## 12.0 Stage 5 — Automated Repair

Automated Repair responds to validation failures and repository findings.

This stage uses repair analysis and controlled generation to correct artifacts, re-enter validation, and determine whether the loop is converging or diverging.

### 12.1 Required Inputs

* failed validation result
* failed artifact metadata
* failed artifact content reference
* tool findings
* source canonical entities
* repair policy
* prior repair records
* governance constraints

### 12.2 Required Outputs

* repair analysis record
* repair proposal
* repair task record
* revised artifact version or correction record
* supersession metadata when applicable
* revalidation request
* repair outcome record

### 12.3 Repair Limits

| Parameter                                             |                Default | Configurable |

| Maximum total repair iterations per construction plan |                     50 | YES          |
| Escalation threshold for same artifact                | 3 consecutive failures | NO           |

### 12.4 Completion Criteria

Repair is complete only when:

* failed validation is linked to repair record
* repair proposal is produced or escalation is recorded
* affected artifacts are identified
* revised artifacts are admitted to repository state
* revised artifacts are revalidated
* repair outcome is recorded

### 12.5 Failure Rules

Repair MUST NOT continue beyond configured repair limits.

Three consecutive failures on the same artifact MUST escalate.

A repair proposal that cannot identify affected artifacts MUST escalate.

A repaired artifact MUST NOT be promoted without revalidation or valid waiver.

---

## 13.0 Stage 6 — Convergence Evaluation

Convergence Evaluation determines whether the generated system satisfies the current loop scope.

This stage prevents the platform from treating partial success as completion. It checks tasks, artifacts, validations, traceability, governance, and repository integrity.

### 13.1 Required Inputs

* execution graph
* task states
* artifact states
* validation records
* repair records
* traceability graph
* governance state
* repository integrity report

### 13.2 Required Outputs

* convergence outcome
* unresolved issue list
* next action decision

### 13.3 Convergence Outcomes

| Outcome             | Meaning                                                   |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| converged           | All required criteria satisfied                           |
| repair-required     | Validation or repository failure can be repaired          |
| replan-required     | Plan is insufficient or invalid                           |
| waiver-required     | Validation or policy exception requires governance waiver |
| escalation-required | Human or governance decision required                     |
| failed              | Required criteria cannot be satisfied                     |
| halted              | Runtime or governance halt applies                        |

### 13.4 Convergence Criteria

The loop converges only when:

* all required tasks are completed, skipped, or waived
* all required artifacts are valid or waived
* no required validation is missing
* no blocking repair remains unresolved
* repository integrity passes
* traceability integrity passes
* governance gates are closed or validly waived
* evidence bundle can be created

### 13.5 Convergence Rules

The loop MUST NOT converge when required validation failed.

The loop MUST NOT converge when stable artifacts are untraced.

The loop MUST NOT converge when governance blocks continuation.

The loop MUST NOT converge solely because no runnable tasks remain.

---

## 14.0 Stage 7 — Artifact Packaging

* package evidence is retained
* package traceability links exist

### 14.4 Packaging Rules

Packaging MUST NOT include failed artifacts.

Packaging MUST NOT include untraced artifacts.

Packaging MUST NOT include waived artifacts without recording waiver references in the package manifest.

Packaging failures MUST trigger repair, repackaging, escalation, or failure.

---

## 15.0 Stage 8 — Deployment Preparation

Deployment Preparation prepares packaged artifacts for operational deployment.

This stage bridges construction and operation. It does not necessarily deploy the system; it prepares the deployment evidence, manifests, infrastructure definitions, and authorization records required for deployment.

### 15.1 Required Inputs

## 26.0 Conformance Requirements

### 26.1 Loop Run Conformance

A loop run conforms to ISL v3.6 if it:

* declares loop inputs
* creates a loop run record
* maintains explicit lifecycle state
* executes required stages for its loop-run-type
* records stage outputs
* enforces reuse discovery before applicable artifact generation
* enforces Construction Boundary and Connection Context controls
* enforces validation before artifact promotion
* enforces bounded repair
* evaluates convergence using required criteria
* applies governance controls
* records traceability
* emits telemetry
* produces evidence bundle and completion report

### 26.2 Initial Construction Loop Conformance

An initial construction loop conforms to ISL v3.6 if it:

* begins from a versioned specification
* performs interpretation, reuse-aware planning, reuse-gated generation, validation, repair where needed, convergence, and closure
* produces stable artifacts only after validation and traceability
* produces completion evidence

### 26.3 Change-Driven Loop Conformance

A change-driven loop conforms to ISL v3.6 if it:

* records a change trigger
* performs impact analysis
* identifies affected and unaffected artifacts
* identifies affected reusable assets and reuse decisions
* applies required actions
* revalidates or regenerates affected artifacts
* preserves unaffected stable artifacts only when justified
* records re-entry evidence

### 26.4 Packaging Loop Conformance

A packaging loop conforms to ISL v3.6 if it:

* uses stable artifacts
* creates package manifests
* references exact artifact versions
* performs package validation
* records package evidence
* preserves package traceability

### 26.5 Deployment Preparation Loop Conformance

A deployment preparation loop conforms to ISL v3.6 if it:

* begins from package records or stable artifacts
* produces deployment preparation records
* verifies environment compatibility
* records operational readiness findings
* routes deployment authorization through governance where required

### 26.6 Platform Conformance

A platform conforms to ISL v3.6 if it:

* implements the Autonomous Development Loop as a stateful, governed control cycle
* supports initial construction and change-driven re-entry
* integrates planning, runtime, agents, models, tools, artifacts, validation, repair, packaging, deployment preparation, state, governance, traceability, and telemetry
* prevents unbounded repair
* prevents evidence-free completion
* prevents governance bypass
* prevents reuse-decision bypass
* prevents context drift across Construction Boundaries
* prevents unvalidated artifacts from becoming stable
* supports loop testing and recovery

---

## 27.0 Summary

ISL v3.6 defines the Autonomous Development Loop for the ALETHEIA platform. It specifies the governed feedback cycle through which formal specifications become validated, traceable, repository-controlled, package-ready, and deployment-prepared software artifacts.

This revision strengthens the original loop model by converting a conceptual sequence into a normative control system. It defines lifecycle states, transition rules, loop inputs, loop outputs, loop run records, stage gates, validation requirements, repair limits, convergence criteria, packaging gates, deployment preparation gates, change-driven re-entry, impact analysis, governance control points, state requirements, evidence requirements, telemetry, terminal outcomes, error classes, testing requirements, and conformance requirements.

A conforming Autonomous Development Loop MUST not merely generate and inspect code. It MUST control autonomous construction as a bounded, evidence-based, governed, traceable, observable, recoverable, and repeatable development cycle.
