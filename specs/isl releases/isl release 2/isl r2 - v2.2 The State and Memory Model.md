# ALETHEIA Specification Language (ISL) v2.2

# The State and Memory Model

**Status:** Normative
**Release:** r2
**Depends On:** ISL v0.0, ISL v1.1, ISL v1.2, ISL v1.3, ISL v1.4, ISL v1.5, ISL v1.6, ISL v1.7, ISL v2.0, ISL v2.1
**Supersedes:** ISL r0 v2.2 The State and Memory Model
**Document Type:** Platform State, Memory, and Consistency Specification

---

## 1.0 Scope

This document defines the State and Memory Model for the ALETHEIA platform. It establishes how platform state is represented, persisted, versioned, updated, validated, recovered, queried, and exposed to authorized subsystems and agents during autonomous software construction.

This document applies to all state and memory maintained by the ALETHEIA platform across specification authoring, canonical normalization, readiness evaluation, construction planning, execution, agent collaboration, deterministic validation, repair cycles, artifact lifecycle management, governance enforcement, deployment preparation, observability, and audit.

This document defines:

* state and memory principles
* categories of platform state
* state record schemas
* state transition rules
* cross-state consistency requirements
* durable memory structures
* event log requirements
* snapshot requirements
* recovery and resumption behavior
* agent memory access rules
* state versioning and evolution
* retention and archival rules
* integrity checks
* state and memory error classes
* conformance requirements

---

## 2.0 Purpose of the State and Memory Model

The purpose of the State and Memory Model is to ensure that the ALETHEIA platform can maintain continuity across long-running autonomous construction activity. Autonomous construction may involve many specifications, task graphs, reasoning agents, deterministic tools, validation cycles, repair attempts, governance gates, artifact versions, and deployment preparation activities. Without a structured state and memory model, the platform would be unable to coordinate these activities safely.

State represents the current operational condition of the platform. Memory represents the durable historical record of how the platform reached that condition. State allows the platform to decide what should happen next. Memory allows the platform to explain what happened before, recover after interruption, support audit, and evolve systems over time.

The State and Memory Model exists to ensure that:

* execution can resume after interruption
* task status remains consistent with artifact and validation status
* specification versions are linked to derived plans and artifacts
* agent outputs are preserved and reusable under controlled rules
* governance records remain durable and auditable
* traceability relationships are preserved across lifecycle events
* impact analysis can compare current and historical states
* recovery procedures can detect and repair inconsistent state
* no subsystem relies on hidden, unstructured, or transient memory for critical decisions

## 4.0 Terms and Definitions

This section defines terms specific to platform state and memory. These terms distinguish current operational state from durable historical memory and clarify how the platform records change over time.

**State**
The current operational condition of a platform object, subsystem, lifecycle phase, task, artifact, validation, governance gate, agent invocation, or execution graph.

**Memory**
Durable historical records preserving prior state, lifecycle events, decisions, artifacts, validations, governance actions, and traceability relationships.

**State Record**
A structured record representing the current state of a platform object.

**State Transition**
A controlled movement from one allowed state value to another.

**State Event**
An immutable record that a state transition or significant lifecycle event occurred.

**Memory Store**
A durable storage mechanism that preserves historical records, event logs, snapshots, documents, graph state, and evidence.

**Snapshot**
A point-in-time capture of one or more state categories or graph structures.

**Checkpoint**
A runtime marker indicating a safe recovery point.

**Recovery**
The process of restoring consistent platform state after interruption, crash, halt, or partial failure.

**State Consistency**
The condition in which related state categories agree according to defined invariants.

**State Drift**
A condition in which related state records become inconsistent, stale, orphaned, or contradictory.

**Working Memory**
Task-scoped or session-scoped context assembled for a limited operation.

**Persistent Memory**
Durable records retained beyond a single task, session, or runtime process.

## 5.0 State and Memory Design Principles

This section defines the principles governing state and memory. These principles ensure that the platform can coordinate long-running activity, recover safely, preserve audit evidence, and avoid hidden or inconsistent operational context.

### 5.1 State Is Explicit

All lifecycle-relevant state MUST be represented in structured platform records. The platform MUST NOT rely on hidden process memory, transient prompt context, implicit local variables, file names, or informal logs as the only source of truth for critical lifecycle decisions.

Explicit state is required for runtime scheduling, recovery, governance, traceability, and audit.

### 5.2 Memory Is Durable

Historical records that support traceability, audit, recovery, governance, validation, or artifact reconstruction MUST be persisted durably.

A platform MUST NOT lose governance approvals, traceability links, validation results, repair records, artifact associations, or readiness transitions when a process restarts.

### 5.3 State Transitions Are Controlled

State values MUST change only through defined transitions. Invalid transitions MUST be rejected or escalated.

Controlled transitions prevent artifacts, tasks, approvals, and execution phases from entering impossible or unsafe combinations.

### 5.4 State and Memory Are Versioned

Specifications, canonical models, construction plans, execution graphs, artifacts, governance records, agent outputs, and traceability snapshots MUST preserve version context.

The platform MUST be able to distinguish the current state of the latest version from the historical state of prior versions.

### 5.5 State Consistency Is Enforced

Related state categories MUST remain consistent. For example, a task MUST NOT be completed if its required artifact remains pending, and an artifact MUST NOT be stable if required validation failed.

The platform MUST perform consistency checks at defined checkpoints.

### 5.6 Memory Access Is Governed

Agents and subsystems MUST access memory through controlled interfaces. They MUST receive only the state and memory relevant to their task, role, risk tier, authorization, and context package.

Memory access MUST preserve security, privacy, governance, and traceability constraints.

### 5.7 Recovery Must Be Deterministic

After interruption, restart, crash, or controlled halt, the platform MUST reconstruct state deterministically from durable records, snapshots, and event logs.

A platform MUST NOT continue execution from uncertain or contradictory state without recovery validation.

---

## 6.0 State and Memory Architecture

This section defines the architectural organization of state and memory. The State and Memory Model does not require one specific database technology. It defines logical stores and responsibilities that a conforming implementation must provide.

State and memory MAY be implemented using relational databases, graph databases, document stores, object stores, event logs, filesystem-backed state, embedded databases, or hybrid storage mechanisms. The implementation is acceptable only if it preserves the semantics required by this document.

### 6.1 Logical Stores

| Store                     | Responsibility                                                                                       |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Current State Store       | Maintains latest state records for platform objects                                                  |
| Event Log                 | Records immutable state transition and lifecycle events                                              |
| Graph Store               | Maintains canonical, traceability, and dependency relationships                                      |
| Artifact Metadata Store   | Maintains artifact metadata, status, versions, and repository links                                  |
| Governance Record Store   | Maintains approvals, waivers, overrides, policies, and audit records                                 |
| Agent Memory Store        | Maintains agent invocations, context packages, outputs, handoffs, failures, and conflicts            |
| Evidence Store            | Maintains validation reports, tool outputs, test reports, security findings, and deployment evidence |
| Snapshot Store            | Maintains point-in-time state, graph, and lifecycle snapshots                                        |
| Configuration State Store | Maintains versioned platform, runtime, tool, model, and governance configuration                     |

### 6.2 Store Rules

A conforming platform MAY combine logical stores into the same physical storage backend.

A conforming platform MUST preserve the logical responsibilities of each store.

State records that affect readiness, execution, artifact validity, governance, traceability, or deployment MUST be durable.

Event logs and governance audit records MUST be append-only or integrity-protected.

---

## 7.0 Platform State Categories

This section defines the required categories of platform state. These categories correspond to major lifecycle concerns and platform subsystems. The original v2.2 model identified specification, planning, execution, artifact, and governance state as core categories; this revision formalizes those categories and extends them to cover traceability, agent, tool, model, observability, and configuration state.

### 7.1 Required State Categories

| State Category        | Description                                                                            |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Specification State   | Current and historical authored specification and readiness metadata                   |

| Readiness State       | Readiness level, transition records, evidence packages, and regression state           |
| Planning State        | Construction plans, task graphs, dependencies, critical path, and plan adaptation      |
| Execution State       | Execution graphs, phases, tasks, runtime activity, repair, and completion              |
| Artifact State        | Artifact metadata, versions, validation status, repository location, and lifecycle     |
| Traceability State    | Traceability graph, snapshots, integrity checks, and impact analysis                   |

| Tool State            | Tool records, trust profiles, invocations, findings, and version drift                 |
| Agent State           | Agent invocations, context packages, outputs, handoffs, failures, and conflicts        |
| Model State           | Model provider records, model invocations, routing decisions, and output normalization |
| Reuse State           | Reusable asset records, Reuse Fitness Assessments, Reuse Decisions, and dependency state |
| Observability State   | Telemetry events, alerts, metrics, logs, traces, and monitoring summaries              |
| Configuration State   | Runtime, platform, governance, tool, model, and deployment configuration               |

### 7.2 Category Rules

Each required state category MUST have a defined owner subsystem.

Each state category MUST define current state records and historical memory records where applicable.

State categories MUST be linked through identifiers rather than unstructured textual references.

State category updates MUST emit events when the update affects lifecycle behavior, governance, traceability, validation, or execution.

---

## 8.0 Common State Record Schema

This section defines the common fields that SHOULD appear in platform state records. Specific state categories extend this schema with category-specific fields.

State records MUST NOT be silently overwritten when historical reconstruction is required.

State records associated with specification-scoped activity MUST include specification-id and specification-version.

---

## 9.0 State Event Model

This section defines the event model used to record state changes. State events are the durable memory of how state evolved over time. They provide the basis for recovery, audit, debugging, telemetry correlation, and historical reconstruction.

State records represent the current condition. State events represent the chronological history.

### 9.1 State Event Schema

State events MUST be append-only where used for audit or recovery.

State events MUST be ordered within their scope using event-sequence or equivalent ordering.

A state event MUST NOT be removed from historical memory unless retention policy permits archival and audit requirements are preserved.

### 9.3 Required State Event Types

The platform MUST emit state events for:

* specification-created
* specification-versioned
* canonical-model-generated
* readiness-transitioned
* readiness-regressed
* construction-plan-created

A specification version that reached Machine-Valid or Autonomous-Ready MUST NOT be deleted from memory while its generated artifacts remain active.

A new specification version MUST NOT overwrite the prior version’s state.

---

## 11.0 Canonical Model State

This section defines Canonical Model State. Canonical Model State records the normalized semantic representation of a specification and its validation outcome.

Canonical Model State is required because planning, traceability, readiness, and execution depend on the canonical graph, not on authored prose alone.

### 11.2 Canonical Model State Rules

A canonical model with validation-status failed MUST NOT support Machine-Valid readiness.

A canonical model version MUST reference exactly one specification version.

A specification version MAY have multiple canonical model attempts, but only one current valid canonical model MAY be active for planning at a time.

Canonical Model State MUST be preserved for historical versions used in planning or execution.

---

## 12.0 Readiness State

This section defines Readiness State. Readiness State records the maturity and authorization condition of a specification version according to ISL v1.3.

Readiness State is a hard control input for planning and execution. It must be durable, version-specific, and governance-aware.

### 12.1 Readiness State Schema

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| readiness-state-id | string | REQUIRED | Unique readiness state identifier |
| specification-id | string | REQUIRED | System identifier |

A specification version MUST have exactly one current Readiness State.

Autonomous-Ready Readiness State MUST reference governance authorization.

Regression MUST update Readiness State and emit readiness-regressed event.

Planning and execution subsystems MUST consult Readiness State before formal planning or execution.

---

## 13.0 Planning State

This section defines Planning State. Planning State records the current and historical condition of construction plans, task graphs, dependencies, critical path, verification plans, and adaptation records.

Planning State enables the platform to resume planning, adapt plans after change, and hand off validated plans to execution.

### 13.1 Planning State Schema

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| planning-state-id | string | REQUIRED | Unique planning state identifier |
| plan-id | string | REQUIRED | Construction plan identifier |

| updated-at | ISO 8601 | REQUIRED | Last update time |

### 13.2 Planning State Rules

A plan MUST NOT be marked executable unless planning validation passed.

A plan marked executable MUST reference Machine-Valid or Autonomous-Ready specification state.

A plan used by active execution MUST NOT be overwritten by adaptation. Adaptation MUST create a new plan version or explicitly versioned graph state.

A superseded plan MUST remain queryable if it was used for execution, governance review, or audit.

---

## 14.0 Execution State

This section defines Execution State. Execution State records the current condition of runtime execution, including execution graph status, phase status, task status, repair state, and completion state.

Execution State MUST NOT be marked completed unless ISL v1.2 completion criteria are satisfied.

Execution State MUST enter recovering during recovery validation after interruption.

Execution State MUST NOT resume from recovering until consistency checks pass.

| completed   | Execution completed successfully                        |
| failed      | Execution ended because required criteria failed        |
| escalated   | Execution requires governance or human action           |
| halted      | Execution was stopped by runtime, policy, or governance |
| recovering  | Execution is validating state for recovery              |

---

## 15.0 Task State

This section defines Task State. Task State records the current lifecycle status of construction tasks within a construction plan or execution graph.

---

## 25.0 Working Memory and Persistent Memory

This section distinguishes working memory from persistent memory. The distinction is important because agents and runtime processes need temporary context, while the platform also needs durable historical records.

Working memory supports immediate task execution. Persistent memory supports continuity, audit, recovery, and evolution.

### 25.1 Working Memory

Working memory MAY include:

* task-scoped context packages
* active agent prompt context
* temporary validation working files
* runtime scheduling queues
* in-progress tool outputs
* transient repair analysis context

Working memory MUST NOT be the only storage location for records required for traceability, audit, governance, recovery, or artifact reconstruction.

### 25.2 Persistent Memory

Persistent memory MUST include:

* specification versions
* canonical model versions
* readiness records
* construction plans
* execution graphs
* task state history
* artifact metadata and versions
* validation results
* repair records
* governance records
* traceability graphs and snapshots
* agent invocation and output records
* tool invocation and evidence records
* model invocation metadata
* configuration history
* audit logs

### 25.3 Memory Promotion

When working memory produces lifecycle-relevant output, the platform MUST promote that output into persistent memory before it affects downstream state.

For example:

* an agent output used for implementation MUST be persisted
* a validation result used for artifact acceptance MUST be persisted
* a governance decision used for continuation MUST be persisted
* a repair proposal used to modify an artifact MUST be persisted

---

## 26.0 State Transition Transaction Model

This section defines how state transitions are committed. State transitions often affect multiple state categories. For example, a validation failure may update Validation State, Artifact State, Task State, Repair State, Execution State, Traceability State, and telemetry.

The platform must prevent partial state updates from creating inconsistent conditions.

### 26.1 Transaction Requirements

A state transition affecting multiple state categories MUST be applied atomically or through a compensating transaction pattern that preserves consistency.

At minimum, the platform MUST ensure that:

* either all required state updates complete successfully, or
* incomplete updates are detectable and recoverable, and
* recovery can determine the last consistent state

### 26.2 State Transition Transaction Schema

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| transaction-id | string | REQUIRED | Unique transition transaction identifier |
| transaction-type | string | REQUIRED | Type of transition transaction |

| started-at | ISO 8601 | REQUIRED | Start time |
| completed-at | ISO 8601 | CONDITIONAL | Completion time |
| status | enum | REQUIRED | pending, committed, failed, compensating, compensated |
| recovery-action | string | CONDITIONAL | Required when transaction fails |

### 26.3 Transaction Rules

A committed transaction MUST have corresponding state events.

A failed transaction MUST enter failed or compensating state.

Compensating actions MUST be recorded as events.

A platform MUST NOT continue execution from a failed transaction unless recovery has validated consistency.

---

## 27.0 Cross-State Consistency Rules

This section defines consistency invariants across state categories. These rules are mandatory and MUST be checked at defined lifecycle checkpoints and recovery points.

Cross-state consistency is essential because different subsystems update different state categories. The platform must detect impossible combinations.

### 27.1 Required Consistency Invariants

| Invariant                  | Rule                                                                     |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

| Repair-to-Artifact         | Repaired artifact state MUST reference repair record                     |
| Governance-to-Action       | Governed action MUST reference allow, approval, waiver, or override      |
| Tool-to-Validation         | Tool-produced validation state MUST reference tool invocation result     |

| Deployment-to-Artifact     | Deployment preparation state MUST reference stable or approved artifacts |
| Completion-to-Evidence     | Completed execution MUST reference completion report and evidence        |

### 27.2 Consistency Checkpoints

The platform MUST perform consistency checks at:

* canonical validation completion
* readiness transition
* construction plan validation
* execution start
* task completion
* artifact state transition to valid or stable
* validation failure
* repair completion
* governance approval or waiver application
* artifact consolidation
* deployment preparation
* execution completion
* recovery after interruption
* specification version change

### 27.3 Consistency Failure Behavior

A consistency failure MUST produce a State Consistency Error Record.

A blocking consistency failure MUST prevent the lifecycle action associated with the checkpoint.

Recovery MUST be initiated when a consistency failure is detected after interruption or crash.

---

## 28.0 Snapshot and Checkpoint Model

This section defines snapshots and checkpoints. Snapshots capture state at important lifecycle moments. Checkpoints identify safe recovery positions during execution.

Snapshots and checkpoints support recovery, audit, comparison, rollback analysis, and debugging.

### 28.1 Snapshot Types

* deployment preparation
* high-risk repair
* governance override application
* repository branch merge or promotion
* execution halt or suspension

A recovery-eligible checkpoint MUST include enough information to resume or safely roll back affected execution state.

---

## 29.0 Recovery and Resumption

This section defines recovery behavior after interruption, crash, process restart, infrastructure failure, governance halt, or partial transaction failure. Recovery is one of the primary reasons state and memory must be structured and durable.

Recovery must not guess. It must reconstruct and validate platform state before continuing.

### 29.1 Recovery Preconditions

The platform MAY attempt recovery only if:

* durable state records are accessible
* event logs are accessible
* latest relevant snapshots are accessible or reconstructible
* governance state is accessible
* traceability state is accessible
* artifact repository state is accessible
* configuration state is known
* recovery actor or subsystem has authority to perform recovery

### 29.2 Recovery Process

Recovery MUST proceed through the following steps:

1. Enter recovering state for affected execution or subsystem.
2. Load latest durable state records.
3. Load latest relevant snapshots.
4. Replay or inspect state events after the snapshot.
5. Validate state transition transactions.
6. Check cross-state consistency invariants.
7. Compare artifact repository state with artifact metadata.
8. Compare traceability graph with artifact and task state.
9. Compare governance state with pending or blocked actions.
10. Determine safe resume point, rollback action, or escalation.
11. Record Recovery Event.
12. Resume, halt, or escalate according to recovery outcome.

### 29.3 Recovery Outcome Values

If recovery-outcome is rollback-required, rollback MUST use a recovery-eligible checkpoint.

If recovery-outcome is compensation-required, compensating actions MUST be recorded as state events.

If recovery-outcome is manual-review-required, the platform MUST open an escalation.

If state is corrupt, the platform MUST halt affected execution and notify governance or operations.

| requester-role | string | CONDITIONAL | Agent role or governance role |
| task-id | string | CONDITIONAL | Related task |
| specification-id | string | CONDITIONAL | System identifier |
| specification-version | semver | CONDITIONAL | Specification version |
| requested-state-categories | array | REQUIRED | Categories requested |

### 30.3 Agent Memory Access Rules

Agents MUST access memory through context packages or approved memory access interfaces.

Agents MUST NOT query unrestricted platform memory directly.

Memory provided to agents MUST be scoped to task, role, governance constraints, and sensitivity classification.

Memory access MUST be recorded when it includes restricted, confidential, governance, security, or artifact content.

---

## 31.0 Memory Retention and Archival

This section defines retention and archival requirements. State and memory records may accumulate over time, but enterprise auditability requires that important records remain available according to retention policy.

Retention rules must balance storage cost, operational performance, auditability, privacy, and governance obligations.

### 31.1 Minimum Retention Requirements

The platform MUST retain the following for the life of any generated system unless governance defines longer retention:

* specification versions that reached Machine-Valid or Autonomous-Ready
* canonical model versions used for planning or execution
* readiness transition records
* construction plans used for execution
* execution graphs and completion reports
* artifact metadata and artifact version history
* validation results supporting artifact acceptance
* repair records
* traceability snapshots
* governance approvals, waivers, overrides, escalations, and audit logs
* deployment authorization records
* configuration versions active during execution

### 31.2 Archival Rules

Archived records MUST remain discoverable by identifier.

Archival MUST preserve traceability and audit relationships.

Archived records MUST NOT be required for active execution unless restored or rehydrated.

Archival MUST NOT break readiness, governance, traceability, or artifact audit queries for retained systems.

### 31.3 Deletion Rules

Deletion of state or memory records MUST be governed by retention policy.

Records required for audit, traceability, legal compliance, or active artifact reconstruction MUST NOT be deleted.

Deletion events MUST themselves be auditable when deletion is permitted.

---

## 32.0 State and Memory Integrity Checks

This section defines integrity checks required to verify that state and memory remain reliable. Integrity checks detect broken references, missing events, invalid transitions, inconsistent statuses, corrupted snapshots, and mismatched repository state.

### 32.1 Required Integrity Checks

A conforming platform MUST check:

* state record schema validity
* event sequence continuity
* allowed state transitions
* cross-state consistency invariants
* snapshot integrity
* traceability link presence

### 32.3 Integrity Failure Rules

A failed integrity check affecting active execution MUST pause or halt affected execution until recovery or governance resolution.

A failed integrity check affecting governance audit records MUST block governance-controlled actions.

A failed integrity check affecting stable artifacts MUST prevent deployment authorization.

## 34.0 Observability of State and Memory

This section defines observability requirements for state and memory. Operators must be able to see platform state transitions, consistency failures, recovery attempts, memory access, and snapshot behavior.

Observability does not replace durable state or audit records. It provides operational visibility.

### 34.1 Required Telemetry Events

The platform SHOULD emit telemetry for:

* state record created
* state transition attempted
* state transition committed
* state transition rejected
* state transaction failed
* snapshot created
* checkpoint created
* recovery started
* recovery completed
* consistency check passed
* consistency check failed
* memory access requested
* memory access denied
* archival completed
* retention violation detected

### 34.2 Telemetry Rules

Telemetry events SHOULD include correlation identifiers linking them to state records, events, tasks, executions, artifacts, governance actions, or recovery actions.

Telemetry MUST NOT expose restricted memory content to unauthorized observers.

Telemetry SHOULD align with the observability conventions defined in ISL v2.6.

## 36.0 Summary

ISL v2.2 defines the State and Memory Model for the ALETHEIA platform. It establishes how operational state and durable memory are represented, persisted, versioned, transitioned, validated, recovered, queried, retained, and governed.

This revision strengthens the original model by turning state and memory from broad conceptual categories into explicit platform contracts. It defines state categories, schemas, transition rules, transaction behavior, consistency invariants, snapshots, recovery procedures, memory access controls, retention obligations, integrity checks, error classes, and conformance requirements.

A conforming ALETHEIA platform MUST treat state and memory as foundational infrastructure. Autonomous construction cannot be reliable if the platform cannot remember what happened, know what is happening now, recover after interruption, and prove that its current state is consistent with its specification, artifacts, validations, governance, and traceability records.
