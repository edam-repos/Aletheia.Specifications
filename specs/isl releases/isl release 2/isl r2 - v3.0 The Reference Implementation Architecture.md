## 1.0 Scope

This document defines the Reference Implementation Architecture for the ALETHEIA platform. It specifies the implementation-level components, service boundaries, module responsibilities, internal contracts, persistence boundaries, integration points, runtime deployment assumptions, and conformance requirements for a reference implementation of the platform architecture defined in ISL v2.0.

This document does not require a single programming language, framework, database, model provider, cloud provider, or deployment platform. It defines a technology-neutral reference architecture that implementations MAY realize using different stacks while preserving the required logical boundaries and behavioral contracts.

This document defines:

* reference implementation principles
* implementation layers
* core modules
* service boundaries
* internal API categories
* persistence components
* runtime components
* model and tool gateways
* artifact repository integration
* governance and traceability integration
* observability integration
* configuration and dependency rules
* testing expectations
* implementation conformance requirements

---

## 2.0 Purpose of the Reference Implementation Architecture

The purpose of the Reference Implementation Architecture is to translate the platform architecture into an implementable system structure. The v2.x corpus defines what the ALETHEIA platform must do. This document defines how a reference implementation should organize those responsibilities into concrete modules, services, interfaces, stores, workers, and integration boundaries.

The reference implementation is not merely a prototype. It is the baseline architecture from which reference construction, local-first, team, enterprise, distributed, and regulated deployments may evolve. It must therefore be simple enough to implement incrementally while remaining structurally sound enough to support enterprise hardening.

The Reference Implementation Architecture exists to ensure that:

* platform subsystems have clear implementation boundaries
* implementation modules align with the normative v2.x architecture
* local-first operation can evolve into distributed deployment
* agent, model, tool, repository, governance, traceability, state, and telemetry concerns remain separated
* deterministic validation and governance cannot be bypassed
* persistence and state are explicit
* implementation components are testable
* future reference pipelines can be built without architectural rework

---

## 5.0 Reference Implementation Design Principles

### 5.1 Preserve Logical Architecture

The reference implementation MUST preserve the logical subsystem boundaries defined in ISL v2.0, even when implemented as a single process or local application.

Combining modules for convenience MUST NOT allow bypass of specification parsing, canonical normalization, planning validation, runtime governance, deterministic validation, traceability recording, artifact repository admission, or state consistency.

### 5.2 Prefer Modular Monolith Before Distributed Complexity

The first reference implementation SHOULD begin as a modular monolith or small set of services with strong internal boundaries. This supports local-first development and reduces operational complexity while preserving a path toward distributed deployment.

The implementation MUST avoid hard dependencies that prevent later extraction of services, workers, gateways, or stores.

### 5.3 Contracts Before Implementation Detail

The reference implementation MUST define explicit contracts between major modules before relying on implementation-specific coupling.

Interfaces, request records, result records, state records, and event records SHOULD be defined independently of concrete adapters and storage mechanisms.

### 5.4 Deterministic Validation Is a Hard Boundary

Generated artifacts MUST pass through deterministic validation or governance waiver before promotion. The implementation MUST NOT allow model output or agent output to bypass tool validation when validation is applicable.

### 5.5 Governance Is Runtime-Enforced

Governance MUST be implemented as an enforceable runtime decision service or module. It MUST NOT be limited to passive metadata, comments, or post-execution reporting.

### 5.6 Traceability Is Written During Execution

Traceability links MUST be created as lifecycle events occur. The implementation MUST NOT rely solely on after-the-fact reconstruction.

### 5.7 Local-First, Enterprise-Ready

The reference implementation SHOULD run locally with local stores, local tools, and local or configured model providers. The same logical architecture MUST also support migration to enterprise infrastructure.

---

## 6.0 Reference Implementation Layers

The reference implementation SHALL be organized into implementation layers.

| Layer               | Responsibility                                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Interface Layer     | APIs, CLIs, UI endpoints, command handlers, external-facing contracts           |
| Application Layer   | Use cases, orchestration flows, service coordination                            |
| Domain Layer        | ISL entities, task graphs, policies, state machines, validation rules           |
| Runtime Layer       | Scheduling, workers, queues, leases, locks, execution graph                     |
| Integration Layer   | Model adapters, tool adapters, repository adapters, identity adapters           |
| Persistence Layer   | State stores, traceability graph stores, artifact metadata stores, audit stores |
| Observability Layer | Telemetry emission, logs, traces, metrics, alerts                               |
| Configuration Layer | Runtime, model, tool, governance, deployment, and environment configuration     |

### 6.1 Layering Rules

Interface components MUST NOT directly mutate persistence stores.

Integration adapters MUST NOT contain domain policy logic except adapter-specific validation.

Runtime components MUST use domain and application contracts to perform lifecycle actions.

Persistence components MUST preserve records defined by ISL v2.2, v2.3, and v1.7.

Observability components MUST observe but not decide lifecycle progression.

Governance decisions MUST be enforced by application and runtime layers before controlled actions proceed.

---

## 9.0 Reference Service Topology

The reference service topology defines how services interact during construction.

The Execution Service is the operational coordinator. It consumes an executable construction plan, schedules tasks, invokes agents through the Agent module and Model Gateway, invokes deterministic tools through the Tool Gateway, writes artifacts through the Artifact Service, records traceability through the Traceability Service, consults governance through the Governance Service, and emits telemetry through the Telemetry Service.

### 9.1 Primary Service Interactions

Telemetry MUST include correlation identifiers.

Telemetry MUST distinguish operational telemetry from audit records.

Telemetry MUST not expose restricted data without authorization.

* enforces access control where required
* records lifecycle actions
* emits telemetry

## 35.0 Summary

ISL v3.0 defines the Reference Implementation Architecture for the ALETHEIA platform. It translates the platform architecture from the v2.x corpus into implementation-level modules, services, APIs, stores, workers, gateways, contracts, and validation expectations.

This revision strengthens the original reference implementation concept by making implementation boundaries explicit. It defines the module architecture, service topology, persistence boundaries, runtime components, agent/model/tool gateway structure, artifact repository implementation, traceability implementation, governance implementation, state and memory implementation, observability implementation, configuration model, security requirements, testing architecture, extension points, and conformance requirements.

A conforming ALETHEIA reference implementation MUST be more than a demonstration. It MUST be a controlled, modular, testable, traceable, governed, validation-centered architecture that can begin locally and mature into enterprise deployment without violating the core ISL architecture.
