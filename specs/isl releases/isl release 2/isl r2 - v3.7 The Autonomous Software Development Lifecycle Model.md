## 1.0 Scope

This document defines the Autonomous Software Development Lifecycle Model for the ALETHEIA platform. It specifies how ALETHEIA organizes autonomous construction activity into a full enterprise SDLC, including lifecycle phases, phase gates, human roles, platform roles, controlled artifacts, evidence requirements, quality controls, governance controls, operational feedback, release readiness, change management, and lifecycle conformance.

This document does not redefine the Autonomous Development Loop. ISL v3.6 defines the loop-level control cycle for generation, validation, repair, convergence, packaging, deployment preparation, and re-entry. This document defines the broader lifecycle framework that governs when loops begin, what lifecycle phase they support, what evidence must be produced, who may approve transitions, how releases are controlled, how operations feed back into specifications, and how the platform’s autonomous activity maps to enterprise SDLC obligations.

This document defines:

* autonomous SDLC principles
* lifecycle phase model
* lifecycle phase gates
* lifecycle roles and responsibilities
* lifecycle evidence model
* mapping between traditional SDLC phases and ALETHEIA subsystems
* specification governance within the SDLC
* architecture and design governance
* implementation governance
* verification and validation governance
* security and compliance governance
* release and deployment readiness
* operations and monitoring feedback
* maintenance and continuous evolution
* lifecycle metrics
* lifecycle audit requirements
* lifecycle error classes
* conformance requirements

---

## 2.0 Purpose

The purpose of the Autonomous SDLC Model is to define how ALETHEIA fits into, replaces, augments, and governs the software development lifecycle at enterprise scale. Traditional SDLC processes rely on human teams to move requirements through design, implementation, testing, release, operations, and maintenance. ALETHEIA transforms many of those activities into autonomous platform functions performed by specifications, reasoning agents, deterministic tools, runtime orchestration, artifact repositories, traceability graphs, and governance controls.

The Autonomous SDLC Model exists to ensure that autonomous construction remains accountable as a software lifecycle, not merely successful as a code-generation workflow. A generated system is not enterprise-ready simply because it compiles or passes tests. It must have approved specifications, governed readiness, traceable architecture decisions, validated artifacts, security evidence, release evidence, operational readiness evidence, retention controls, and a feedback path for future evolution.

This model exists to ensure that:

* autonomous development is governed across the full lifecycle
* lifecycle phases have explicit entry and exit criteria
* phase transitions are evidence-based
* human oversight is assigned where required
* platform automation is bounded by governance and risk tier
* generated artifacts remain traceable to specification intent
* validation and security evidence are preserved
* release readiness is separated from deployment authorization
* operations and monitoring can trigger controlled re-entry
* lifecycle activity can be audited after completion

## 3.0 Relationship to the Autonomous Development Loop

This section distinguishes the Autonomous SDLC from the Autonomous Development Loop. This distinction is necessary because the loop defines the internal execution cycle, while the SDLC defines lifecycle governance, evidence, roles, and enterprise control.

The Autonomous Development Loop is the mechanism by which the platform performs construction. The Autonomous SDLC is the framework that determines when the loop may run, what lifecycle phase the loop supports, what evidence is required, what approvals are necessary, how outputs are accepted, and how operational feedback becomes future specification work.

### 3.1 Distinction Between v3.6 and v3.7

| Concern            | ISL v3.6 Autonomous Development Loop                                     | ISL v3.7 Autonomous SDLC                                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Primary question   | How does the platform iterate from specification to validated artifacts? | How does the enterprise govern autonomous software development end to end? |
| Unit of control    | Loop run                                                                 | Lifecycle phase and phase gate                                             |
| Main state object  | loop-run-id                                                              | lifecycle-run-id                                                           |
| Core activities    | interpret, plan, generate, validate, repair, converge                    | authorize, govern, evidence, review, release, operate, evolve              |
| Primary controls   | loop states, repair limits, convergence criteria                         | phase gates, role accountability, evidence packages, release criteria      |
| Completion concept | loop success or failure                                                  | lifecycle phase transition or lifecycle closure                            |
| Human involvement  | escalation and governed intervention                                     | phase ownership, approval, review, audit, release accountability           |

### 3.2 SDLC Rules

An Autonomous SDLC phase MAY contain one or more Autonomous Development Loop runs.

An Autonomous Development Loop run MUST be associated with an SDLC phase when executed inside a governed lifecycle.

A loop run that produces release-impacting artifacts MUST produce evidence usable by the SDLC phase gate.

A lifecycle phase MUST NOT transition solely because a loop run succeeded. The phase transition MUST also satisfy lifecycle evidence, governance, security, traceability, and release criteria.

---

## 4.0 Autonomous SDLC Design Principles

### 4.1 Lifecycle Governance Is Mandatory

Every enterprise use of autonomous construction MUST operate within a declared lifecycle model. The platform MUST know whether it is supporting discovery, specification, design, construction, verification, release preparation, deployment authorization, operations, maintenance, or retirement.

### 4.2 Specifications Are Lifecycle Assets

Specifications are not temporary prompts. Specifications MUST be treated as lifecycle assets with ownership, versioning, readiness state, governance history, traceability links, and change control.

### 4.3 Phase Gates Are Evidence-Based

A lifecycle phase MUST NOT close unless required evidence exists. Evidence MAY include specifications, canonical models, readiness reports, construction plans, execution graphs, artifact metadata, validation results, security results, governance decisions, traceability snapshots, release records, operational telemetry, and audit records.

### 4.4 Autonomy Is Risk-Tiered

The degree of permitted autonomy MUST depend on risk tier, governance profile, organizational policy, environment, and system criticality. Standard systems MAY allow more automated progression. High and Critical systems MUST require stronger evidence, review, approval, and retention controls.

### 4.5 Human Accountability Remains Explicit

Autonomous construction MAY automate development activity, but it MUST NOT erase accountability. Lifecycle owners, reviewers, authorizing officials, governance administrators, security reviewers, and operations owners MUST remain explicit where required by policy.

### 4.6 Operations Feed Back Into Specification

Operational telemetry, incidents, defects, security findings, performance findings, and governance findings MUST be capable of creating controlled change triggers that re-enter the lifecycle through specification or maintenance phases.

### 4.7 Release Readiness Is Not Deployment Authorization

A system may be release-ready without being authorized for deployment. Release readiness confirms that artifacts, evidence, packaging, and validation are complete. Deployment authorization is a governance decision allowing deployment to a target environment.

### 4.8 Reuse and Context Boundaries Are Lifecycle Controls

Enterprise autonomous construction MUST treat reuse decisions, reusable asset provenance, Construction Boundaries, and Connection Contexts as lifecycle evidence. These controls reduce duplicated construction, constrain model context, and limit context drift across phases.

---

## 5.0 Autonomous SDLC Lifecycle Phases

This section defines the standard lifecycle phases. A conforming implementation MAY add phases, but it MUST preserve these standard phase meanings or define a documented equivalent.

| Phase | Name                        | Purpose                                                                  |
| ----: | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|     0 | Lifecycle Intake            | Register initiative, scope, ownership, risk tier, and lifecycle profile  |
|     1 | Specification Development   | Author and structure the ISL specification                               |
|     2 | Specification Readiness     | Validate specification and approve readiness progression                 |
|     3 | Architecture and Planning   | Normalize canonical model, discover reuse, and generate construction plan |
|     4 | Autonomous Construction     | Reuse, generate, admit, validate, repair, and stabilize artifacts         |
|     5 | Verification and Validation | Confirm functional, structural, security, policy, and quality evidence   |
|     6 | Release Preparation         | Package stable artifacts and prepare release evidence                    |
|     7 | Deployment Authorization    | Approve or reject deployment to target environment                       |
|     8 | Operations and Monitoring   | Observe deployed system and collect operational feedback                 |
|     9 | Maintenance and Evolution   | Process changes, defects, enhancements, and re-entry                     |
|    10 | Retirement and Archival     | Retire systems, preserve records, archive artifacts, and close lifecycle |

### 5.1 Phase Rules

Each lifecycle phase MUST have an owner or responsible role.

Each lifecycle phase MUST have entry criteria and exit criteria.

Each lifecycle phase MUST produce or reference evidence.

A phase MAY be skipped only when the lifecycle profile explicitly permits skipping and records the rationale.

High and Critical risk systems MUST NOT skip Specification Readiness, Verification and Validation, Deployment Authorization, or Retirement and Archival.

## 10.0 Phase 0 — Lifecycle Intake

Lifecycle Intake registers the initiative and establishes the control context for autonomous development.

This phase ensures that the system is not created as an uncontrolled generation exercise. It establishes ownership, risk tier, lifecycle profile, environment, governance profile, and initial scope.

### 10.1 Entry Criteria

Lifecycle Intake may begin when:

* a new system, change, maintenance request, release request, or retirement request exists
* a responsible owner is identified

### 15.5 Verification Rules

A system MUST NOT proceed to Release Preparation with unresolved blocking validation findings.

A failed security validation MUST block release preparation unless a valid governance waiver exists.

A missing traceability integrity report MUST block release preparation.

---

## 16.0 Phase 6 — Release Preparation

Release Preparation packages stable artifacts and creates release evidence.

This phase maps to release engineering in traditional SDLCs. It does not authorize deployment; it prepares release candidates that may later be submitted for deployment authorization.

### 16.1 Entry Criteria

A release candidate that includes waived findings MUST disclose those waivers in the release evidence package.

---

## 17.0 Phase 7 — Deployment Authorization

Deployment Authorization determines whether a release candidate may be deployed to a target environment.

This phase is a governance phase. It is intentionally separate from Release Preparation because a package may be technically ready but not authorized for a specific environment.

### 17.1 Entry Criteria

Deployment Authorization may begin when:

* release candidate exists
* release evidence package exists
* target environment is identified
* deployment preparation evidence exists where required
* required approvers are assigned

### 17.2 Required Activities

The platform and governance roles MUST:

Expired deployment authorization MUST NOT permit deployment.

---

## 18.0 Phase 8 — Operations and Monitoring

Operations and Monitoring observes deployed systems and collects feedback.

This phase maps to operations, monitoring, incident management, and production support in traditional SDLCs. ALETHEIA uses observability, governance, and traceability to connect operational behavior back to specification and lifecycle state.

### 18.1 Entry Criteria

A successful lifecycle run MUST have a lifecycle evidence package.

High and Critical risk lifecycle evidence packages MUST be retained as audit or archival records.

Evidence packages MUST remain queryable by specification-id, lifecycle-run-id, release candidate, and deployment authorization record.

---

## 22.0 SDLC Quality Model

The Autonomous SDLC MUST support quality evaluation across lifecycle phases.

### 22.1 Quality Categories

The platform SHOULD classify quality evidence using categories aligned with ISO/IEC 25010 concepts, including:

### 22.2 Quality Evidence Rules

A lifecycle profile SHOULD define required quality categories.

High and Critical systems MUST define required security, reliability, and maintainability evidence.

Quality findings MUST be classified as blocking, high, medium, low, or informational.

Blocking quality findings MUST prevent release readiness unless waived.

---

## 23.0 SDLC Metrics

| State       | Meaning                                            |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| not-started | Phase has not begun                                |
| active      | Phase is in progress                               |
| blocked     | Phase cannot proceed due to unresolved condition   |
| completed   | Phase exit criteria satisfied                      |
| skipped     | Phase intentionally skipped under profile rules    |
| escalated   | Phase requires governance or human resolution      |
| failed      | Phase failed and cannot proceed without new action |

### 26.2 SDLC State Rules

Each phase MUST maintain phase state.

Phase state transitions MUST emit state events.

A lifecycle run MUST NOT enter a later phase until prior required phase is completed, skipped, or waived according to profile.

A failed phase MUST prevent lifecycle completion.

* risk-tier assignment
* readiness transition
* phase gate decisions
* approvals
* waivers
* overrides
* security review decisions
* release readiness decisions
* deployment authorization decisions
* post-change reauthorization
* retirement decisions

### 28.2 Audit Rules

Audit records MUST include actor, role, timestamp, decision, scope, and rationale.

Automated platform decisions MUST identify the platform component making the decision.

Human approvals MUST identify authenticated human or authorized role identity.

Audit records MUST be retained according to lifecycle profile and governance policy.

---

## 29.0 SDLC Testing Requirements

The lifecycle model itself MUST be testable.

### 29.1 Required Test Categories

| Test Category            | Purpose                                                    |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| lifecycle-profile        | Validate lifecycle profile schema and rules                |
| phase-entry              | Validate phase entry criteria                              |
| phase-exit               | Validate phase exit criteria                               |
| phase-gate               | Validate gate pass, fail, waiver, escalation behavior      |
| role-assignment          | Validate required role assignment                          |
| evidence-package         | Validate evidence completeness                             |
| readiness-control        | Validate construction cannot begin before Autonomous-Ready |
| release-control          | Validate release cannot proceed with failed evidence       |
| deployment-authorization | Validate deployment cannot proceed without authorization   |
| operations-feedback      | Validate telemetry and incidents create change triggers    |
| maintenance-reentry      | Validate change triggers start governed re-entry           |
| retirement               | Validate archival and retention requirements               |
| governance-audit         | Validate audit records are created and immutable           |

### 29.2 Testing Rules

Lifecycle tests MUST verify that missing evidence blocks phase gates.

Lifecycle tests MUST verify that governance blocks cannot be bypassed.

Lifecycle tests MUST verify that release readiness does not imply deployment authorization.

Lifecycle tests MUST verify that operational feedback can create maintenance re-entry.

## 30.0 SDLC Conformance Requirements

### 30.1 Lifecycle Profile Conformance

A lifecycle profile conforms to ISL v3.7 if it:

* declares required phases
* declares required gates
* declares required roles

* declares evidence requirements
* declares reuse and context-boundary requirements when applicable
* declares automation level
* declares retention profile
* declares governance profile
* is versioned and approved

### 30.2 Lifecycle Run Conformance

A lifecycle run conforms to ISL v3.7 if it:

* references a valid lifecycle profile
* identifies system, specification, version, owner, and risk tier
* tracks phase state
* enforces phase gates
* links loop runs to lifecycle phases
* records reuse evidence when artifact-producing work is in scope
* records Construction Boundary and Connection Context evidence when boundary-scoped work is in scope
* records evidence packages
* preserves lifecycle traceability
* records governance decisions
* produces lifecycle completion or transition records

### 30.3 Phase Gate Conformance

A phase gate conforms to ISL v3.7 if it:

* identifies from-phase and to-phase
* declares required evidence
* declares reuse and boundary/context evidence where applicable
* declares required approver role where applicable
* records pass, fail, waiver, block, or escalation decision
* references governance records where applicable
* blocks transition when failed or pending

### 30.4 Release Readiness Conformance

Release readiness conforms to ISL v3.7 if it:

* references stable artifact versions
* references reusable asset provenance for reuse-derived artifacts
* references validation evidence
* references traceability snapshot
* references package manifest
* records unresolved findings and waivers
* confirms release candidate completeness
* does not imply deployment authorization

### 30.5 Deployment Authorization Conformance

Deployment authorization conforms to ISL v3.7 if it:

* references release candidate
* references target environment
* references operational readiness evidence
* records required approvals
* records validity scope and expiration where applicable
* is issued by required authority
* blocks deployment when absent, expired, or rejected

### 30.6 Platform Conformance

A platform conforms to ISL v3.7 if it:

* supports lifecycle profiles
* supports lifecycle run records
* supports lifecycle phases and gates
* associates autonomous development loop runs with lifecycle phases
* enforces reuse-first lifecycle controls where applicable
* enforces Construction Boundary and Connection Context lifecycle controls
* enforces readiness, validation, release, deployment, operations, maintenance, and retirement controls
* preserves lifecycle evidence packages
* preserves lifecycle traceability
* preserves lifecycle audit records
* supports lifecycle metrics
* prevents phase transitions without required evidence
* prevents deployment without deployment authorization

## 31.0 Summary

ISL v3.7 defines the Autonomous Software Development Lifecycle Model for the ALETHEIA platform. It places autonomous construction inside an enterprise SDLC framework with phases, gates, roles, evidence, governance, release readiness, deployment authorization, operations feedback, maintenance re-entry, retirement, metrics, audit, and conformance.

This revision makes v3.7 materially different from v3.6. ISL v3.6 defines the operational loop that constructs, validates, repairs, packages, and prepares artifacts. ISL v3.7 defines the lifecycle control system that governs when those loops occur, how their outputs are accepted, how human accountability is preserved, how release and deployment are controlled, how operations feeds future change, and how the full lifecycle remains auditable.

A conforming Autonomous SDLC MUST not treat autonomous construction as a shortcut around software engineering governance. It MUST make the lifecycle faster and more traceable while preserving the controls that make enterprise software safe, reviewable, releasable, operable, maintainable, and accountable.
