# The Execution Runtime Model

**Status:** Normative
**Release:** r2
**Depends On:** ISL v0.0, ISL v1.1, ISL v1.2, ISL v1.3, ISL v1.4, ISL v1.5, ISL v1.6, ISL v1.7, ISL v2.0, ISL v2.1, ISL v2.2, ISL v2.3
**Supersedes:** ISL r0 v2.4 The Execution Runtime Model
**Document Type:** Runtime Execution, Scheduling, and Error Handling Specification

---

## 1.0 Scope

This document defines the Execution Runtime Model for the ALETHEIA platform. It establishes how executable construction plans are accepted, scheduled, dispatched, executed, monitored, paused, repaired, resumed, failed, halted, and completed.

This document applies to runtime execution after a specification has reached the readiness state required for autonomous construction and after a valid Construction Task Graph has been produced. It defines runtime lifecycle behavior, task scheduling, worker coordination, queues, leases, locks, retries, timeouts, checkpoints, distributed execution, governance control, runtime isolation, error handling, recovery, and conformance requirements.

This document defines:

* runtime responsibilities
* runtime lifecycle
* execution admission
* task scheduling
* execution queues
* worker model
* task dispatch and leases
* task execution lifecycle
* agent invocation during runtime
* tool invocation during runtime
* artifact repository interaction
* validation and feedback loops
* bounded repair cycles
* parallel and distributed execution
* runtime governance enforcement
* runtime checkpoints and recovery
* runtime error taxonomy
* runtime configuration
* runtime telemetry
* conformance requirements

---

## 2.0 Purpose of the Execution Runtime Model

The purpose of the Execution Runtime Model is to define how the ALETHEIA platform operationally performs autonomous construction. Earlier ISL documents define the specification, semantic model, readiness gates, construction plan, traceability model, tool integration model, governance controls, state model, and artifact repository model. This document defines how those elements become running work.

The execution runtime is the platform’s construction engine. It turns the static Construction Task Graph into controlled runtime activity. It decides which tasks are eligible to run, which worker should execute them, which governance checks apply, which tools or agents must be invoked, which artifacts are produced, which validations must run, and how failures are handled.

The Execution Runtime Model exists to ensure that:

* execution begins only from authorized input
* task scheduling respects dependencies and governance constraints
* runtime work is performed by controlled workers
* artifacts are generated through repository-controlled flows
* deterministic validation gates artifact acceptance
* repair cycles are bounded and observable
* runtime state survives interruption
* distributed execution preserves consistency
* all runtime errors have defined handling paths
* completion is based on evidence rather than optimism

---

## 5.0 Runtime Design Principles

### 5.1 Runtime Is Plan-Driven

The runtime MUST execute work from a valid Construction Task Graph. It MUST NOT execute arbitrary construction work that is not represented as a task, lifecycle obligation, governance action, validation action, or recovery action.

### 5.2 Runtime Is State-Driven

The runtime MUST make scheduling and execution decisions from durable platform state. It MUST NOT depend on hidden process memory as the source of truth for execution progress.

### 5.3 Runtime Is Governed

The runtime MUST consult the Governance Engine at required control points. A governance decision of block, escalate, approval-required, waiver-required, or override-required MUST prevent the governed action from continuing.

### 5.4 Runtime Is Traceable

The runtime MUST create traceability links at the time runtime actions occur. Runtime traceability MUST connect tasks, workers, agents, tools, artifacts, validations, repairs, governance events, and state transitions.

### 5.5 Runtime Is Validation-Centered

The runtime MUST NOT treat generated artifacts as valid until required validation has passed or a valid governance waiver exists.

### 5.6 Runtime Is Recoverable

The runtime MUST persist enough state, events, leases, checkpoints, and artifact metadata to recover safely after interruption.

### 5.7 Runtime Errors Are Structured

Every runtime error that affects execution progress, artifact status, governance, traceability, validation, or recovery MUST be recorded as a structured runtime error.

---

## 6.0 Runtime Responsibilities

This section defines the required responsibilities of the Execution Runtime. The runtime coordinates many subsystems but MUST NOT absorb their responsibilities.

### 6.1 Required Runtime Responsibilities

The Execution Runtime MUST:

* accept execution handoff records from the Planning Engine
* validate execution admission preconditions
* initialize execution state
* maintain execution graph state
* schedule eligible tasks
* manage execution queues
* dispatch work to runtime workers
* manage task leases and runtime locks
* invoke agents through the Agent Orchestrator
* invoke tools through the Tool Integration Layer
* interact with the Artifact Repository through controlled interfaces
* initiate validation tasks
* initiate repair tasks when permitted
* enforce retry, timeout, and repair limits
* consult the Governance Engine at required control points
* update traceability as runtime events occur
* update state and memory according to ISL v2.2
* emit runtime telemetry
* create checkpoints
* recover after interruption
* produce runtime completion records

### 6.2 Runtime Prohibitions

The runtime MUST NOT:

* execute a non-executable construction plan
* begin autonomous construction for a non-Autonomous-Ready specification
* bypass governance checks
* bypass artifact repository admission
* mark artifacts valid without validation or waiver
* modify canonical models directly
* silently drop failed tasks
* retry indefinitely
* treat tool timeout or agent timeout as success
* complete execution while required traceability is incomplete

## 10.0 Execution Admission

Execution admission is the runtime gate that determines whether a construction plan may enter runtime execution.

### 10.1 Admission Checks

The runtime MUST verify:

* specification is Autonomous-Ready
* construction plan status is executable

* canonical model reference exists
* traceability state is initialized and active
* governance state permits execution
* required approval gates are satisfied
* required tool capabilities are available
* required agent roles are available
* required Reuse Decision Records exist for reuse-governed tasks
* selected reusable assets are active and authorized where applicable
* required Construction Boundaries and Connection Contexts are valid
* artifact repository is available
* state store is available
* runtime configuration is valid
* no blocking regression exists
* no expired waiver or override is being used
* no unresolved planning validation error remains

### 10.2 Execution Admission Record Schema

---

## 38.0 Summary

ISL v2.4 defines the Execution Runtime Model for the ALETHEIA platform. It specifies how construction plans become controlled runtime activity through admission checks, scheduling, queues, workers, leases, locks, task execution, agent invocation, tool invocation, artifact handling, validation feedback, repair cycles, governance enforcement, checkpoints, recovery, telemetry, and completion.

This revision strengthens the original runtime model by making runtime behavior operationally explicit. It defines task scheduling, worker execution, queue semantics, concurrency controls, distributed execution, runtime recovery, retry and timeout rules, runtime configuration, security requirements, and a normative error taxonomy addressing ISL-007.

A conforming ALETHEIA runtime MUST behave as a governed, traceable, recoverable, validation-centered execution engine. It MUST not merely coordinate autonomous activity; it MUST control it, record it, validate it, recover it, and stop it when the evidence, state, or governance conditions no longer permit continuation.
