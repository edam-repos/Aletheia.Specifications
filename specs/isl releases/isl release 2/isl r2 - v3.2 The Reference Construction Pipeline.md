---

## 1.0 Scope

In r2 this document is retained as an informative scenario and implementation fixture. Requirements language in this document constrains only the reference scenario when an implementation chooses to claim reference scenario conformance. It MUST NOT define enterprise platform conformance, override normative ISL r2 documents, or make the reference scenario pipeline the center of the ALETHEIA architecture.

This document defines the first reference construction pipeline for the ALETHEIA platform. It specifies the minimum executable workflow required to demonstrate that a structured ISL specification can be transformed into a working software artifact through canonical normalization, construction planning, agent-assisted generation, deterministic validation, bounded repair, artifact finalization, traceability, and telemetry.

This document applies to the first operational milestone of the ALETHEIA reference implementation. It intentionally defines a narrow pipeline. It does not attempt to demonstrate the full enterprise platform, distributed runtime, multi-tenant deployment, advanced governance, advanced security scanning, complex orchestration, or multi-service application construction.

This document defines:

* reference construction objectives
* supported input scope
* minimum platform components
* pipeline stages
* required records and evidence
* task graph requirements
* generated artifact expectations
* deterministic validation requirements
* repair cycle requirements
* artifact finalization rules
* telemetry requirements
* success criteria
* non-goals
* conformance requirements

---

## 2.0 Purpose of the Reference Construction Pipeline

The purpose of the Reference Construction Pipeline is to provide the first executable proof that the ALETHEIA architecture can function in practice. The platform must show that it can accept a structured specification, interpret it through a canonical model, produce a construction plan, generate implementation artifacts, validate those artifacts using deterministic tools, repair failures, and produce stable outputs.

The reference construction scenario is not a product launch. It is an architectural viability test. Its value is not in the complexity of the generated system, but in proving that the construction loop works end to end without relying on informal manual steps, hidden assumptions, or unrecorded decisions.

The reference scenario exists to demonstrate that:

* a structured ISL input can be processed by the platform
* a canonical semantic model can be produced from the input
* a construction task graph can be generated from the model
* agent-generated artifacts can be admitted into an artifact repository
* deterministic tools can validate generated artifacts
* repair cycles can respond to validation failures
* final artifacts can be traced back to specification entities
* telemetry can show what happened during the pipeline
* success can be determined by evidence rather than assertion

---

## 3.0 Reference Construction Design Principles

This section defines principles that constrain the first pipeline. These principles are necessary because the first implementation must be intentionally small while still proving the core ALETHEIA claims.

### 3.1 Narrow Scope, Real Execution

The reference scenario MUST be narrow in supported domain, but it MUST execute real platform behavior. It MUST NOT be a scripted demo that skips canonical normalization, planning, artifact generation, deterministic validation, state recording, or traceability.

The implementation MAY use simplified modules, but those modules MUST preserve the same control boundaries defined in ISL v3.0 and v3.1.

### 3.2 No Fake Success

The reference scenario MUST NOT report success unless generated artifacts compile or otherwise pass the configured deterministic validation tools.

A successful natural-language explanation from an agent MUST NOT be treated as successful validation.

### 3.3 Evidence Before Claim

Every success criterion MUST be supported by a record, artifact, validation result, traceability link, state transition, or telemetry event.

The pipeline MUST produce an evidence bundle sufficient to review the run after completion.

### 3.4 Repair Must Be Bounded

The reference scenario MUST support repair cycles, but repair MUST be bounded by the repair termination rules defined in ISL v1.2, v1.5, and v2.4.

An implementation MUST NOT allow an unbounded generate-validate-repair loop.

### 3.5 Minimal Governance, Not No Governance

The reference scenario MAY use a simplified governance profile. However, it MUST still represent readiness, execution authorization, validation waivers if any, and audit-relevant decisions.

The reference scenario MUST NOT bypass governance-controlled state transitions merely because it is a reference construction scenario.

---

## 4.0 Reference Construction Objectives

This section defines the objectives of the first pipeline. These objectives are intentionally limited and measurable.

### 4.1 Primary Objectives

The reference scenario MUST demonstrate the ability to:

* ingest a structured ISL specification
* validate specification structure
* normalize the specification into canonical entities
* generate a construction task graph
* execute the task graph through the runtime
* invoke at least one implementation-generation agent
* generate source, test, and configuration artifacts
* admit generated artifacts into an artifact repository
* compile or otherwise build the generated system
* execute deterministic validation tests
* detect validation failures
* perform bounded repair cycles
* revalidate repaired artifacts
* finalize stable artifacts
* create traceability links from specification entities to artifacts
* emit telemetry for major pipeline stages
* produce a completion report

### 4.2 Secondary Objectives

The reference scenario SHOULD demonstrate:

* deterministic task ordering
* basic retry behavior
* repair history preservation
* artifact versioning after repair
* tool result normalization
* model invocation traceability
* repository integrity checking
* minimal dashboard or queryable telemetry output
* repeatable execution from the same input

### 4.3 Objective Rules

A primary objective MUST be satisfied for the reference scenario to be considered successful.

A secondary objective SHOULD be satisfied where feasible, but failure to satisfy a secondary objective MUST be recorded as a limitation.

A reference scenario run MUST distinguish primary objective failure from secondary objective limitation.

---

## 5.0 Non-Goals

This section defines what the first reference scenario is not required to prove. Explicit non-goals prevent the first implementation from becoming too broad or ambiguous.

The first reference scenario is not required to demonstrate:

* multi-service distributed system generation
* production deployment
* multi-tenant isolation
* enterprise identity integration
* complex policy governance
* advanced security scanning
* full infrastructure provisioning
* database migration generation
* distributed runtime workers
* high availability
* disaster recovery
* multiple programming languages
* advanced UI generation
* domain-specific enterprise architecture modeling
* human approval workflow automation beyond minimal records

The reference scenario MAY include any of these capabilities only if they do not obscure or weaken the primary objectives.

---

## 6.0 Supported Input Scope

The first reference scenario MUST support a constrained subset of ISL sufficient to describe a minimal service-based application.

The input specification is the pipeline’s starting point. It must be structured enough to be parsed, normalized, planned, and traced. The earlier review identified that the reference construction pipeline’s own input must not be absent; therefore, the reference scenario MUST define and include a concrete input specification fixture. 

### 6.1 Required Input Entities

The reference scenario input specification MUST include at least:

| Entity      | Minimum Count | Purpose                                      |
| ----------- | ------------: | -------------------------------------------- |
| Project     |             1 | Identifies the system being constructed      |
| Context     |             1 | Describes scope and assumptions              |
| Requirement |             1 | Defines expected behavior                    |
| Capability  |             1 | Groups behavior into platform capability     |
| Service     |             1 | Defines the generated service                |
| Interface   |             1 | Defines externally visible operation         |
| DataEntity  |             1 | Defines request or response structure        |
| Validation  |             1 | Defines acceptance or verification condition |

### 6.2 Optional Input Entities

The reference scenario input MAY include:

* Actor
* Workflow
* Policy
* Infrastructure
* additional Requirements
* additional Interfaces
* additional DataEntities
* additional Validations

### 6.3 Input Format Rules

The reference scenario MUST support at least one structured representation format.

The supported input format MUST be documented.

The reference scenario input MUST be stored as a versioned example under the reference repository.

The reference scenario input MUST have deterministic identifiers for canonical entities.

The reference scenario input MUST be sufficient to generate the minimal target system without hidden manual requirements.

---

## 7.0 Required reference scenario Input Fixture

This section defines the minimum required fixture that must exist in the reference implementation repository.

### 7.1 Fixture Location

The reference implementation SHOULD store the reference scenario input fixture at:

`/examples/specifications/reference-scenario/minimal-service.isl.md`

If another location is used, it MUST be documented in the reference scenario run configuration.

### 7.2 Fixture Metadata

The fixture MUST include:

| Field                 | Required | Description                           |

| name                  | YES      | Human-readable system name            |
| owner                 | YES      | Owning role, team, or project         |
| readiness-target      | YES      | Target readiness for reference scenario              |

* at least one validation criterion
* expected success behavior
* expected generated artifact types

### 7.4 Fixture Rules

The fixture MUST be used by automated scenario tests.

The fixture MUST be sufficient to reproduce a reference scenario run.

Changes to the fixture MUST trigger scenario regression testing.

---

## 8.0 Minimal Target System

This section defines the system the reference scenario pipeline must generate. The target system must be intentionally simple but real enough to compile, test, and validate.

The original Reference Construction Scenario document identifies the first reference system as a minimal .NET REST service with a basic project structure, endpoint, data model, and tests.  This document defines the pipeline-level expectations for constructing that system or an equivalent minimal service.

### 8.1 Default Target System

The default reference scenario target system SHOULD be a minimal .NET REST service.

The generated system SHOULD include:

* project file
* program entry point
* minimal service endpoint
* request or response data model
* simple business logic or handler
* unit or integration test project
* minimal configuration file
* repository metadata
* validation evidence

### 8.2 Equivalent Target System

An implementation MAY choose another platform or language if it provides equivalent proof.

An equivalent target system MUST include:

* executable or buildable project structure
* callable interface or operation
* generated source artifact
* generated test artifact
* deterministic build validation
* deterministic test validation
* artifact repository metadata
* traceability links

### 8.3 Target System Rules

The target system MUST be generated from the ISL fixture.

The target system MUST NOT be prewritten and copied as the final output without agent or generation activity.

Boilerplate templates MAY be used only if the generated artifact metadata records which content was templated and which content was derived from specification entities.

The generated system MUST be independently buildable using the declared validation profile.

---

## 9.0 Minimum Platform Components

### 9.2 Permitted Simplifications

The reference scenario MAY simplify:

* identity integration
* distributed worker scheduling
* dashboard presentation
* complex model routing
* enterprise policy libraries
* artifact branch strategy
* deployment packaging
* external telemetry export

### 9.3 Component Rules

A simplified component MUST still preserve the contract of the subsystem it represents.

A mocked or stubbed component MUST be clearly identified in the reference scenario run report.

A mocked or stubbed component MUST NOT be used to satisfy deterministic validation, artifact creation, or completion evidence unless the test explicitly declares itself non-conforming.

---

## 36.0 Summary

ISL v3.2 retains the Reference Construction Pipeline as an informative scenario for the ALETHEIA platform. It turns the original conceptual pipeline into a measurable execution fixture for proving the core autonomous construction loop without defining enterprise platform conformance.

This revision strengthens v3.2 by defining the supported input scope, required fixture, minimal target system, minimum platform components, pipeline stages, stage inputs and outputs, task graph requirements, artifact generation expectations, repository admission rules, deterministic validation requirements, bounded repair behavior, finalization rules, traceability closure, telemetry, evidence bundles, success criteria, failure criteria, failure-injection expectations, repeatability, and scenario conformance requirements.

A reference scenario-conforming implementation proves the real loop: specification to canonical model, canonical model to plan, plan to generated artifacts, artifacts to deterministic validation, validation failure to bounded repair, repaired artifacts to revalidation, and stable artifacts to traceable evidence. Anything less is a demonstration, not a reference construction scenario.
