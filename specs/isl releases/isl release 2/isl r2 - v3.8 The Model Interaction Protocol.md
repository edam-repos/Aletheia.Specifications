## 1.0 Scope

This document defines the Model Interaction Protocol for the ALETHEIA platform. It specifies the formal request, response, context, instruction, output, normalization, validation, error, retry, fallback, traceability, governance, and telemetry rules used when the platform interacts with reasoning models.

This document applies to all model interactions initiated by agents, runtime services, model gateways, repair flows, review flows, security analysis flows, planning flows, artifact generation flows, and deployment preparation flows.

This document defines:

* model interaction principles
* reasoning transaction lifecycle
* model request envelope
* model response envelope
* context package references
* Construction Boundary and Connection Context binding
* instruction structure
* output contract schema
* standard output contract types
* response normalization
* response validation
* retry and correction behavior
* fallback behavior
* deterministic follow-up requirements
* policy and governance controls
* traceability requirements
* telemetry requirements
* protocol versioning
* conformance requirements

---

## 2.0 Purpose

The purpose of the Model Interaction Protocol is to make model use reliable enough for autonomous software construction. A reasoning model may generate plans, code, repair proposals, tests, reviews, security findings, and deployment recommendations. These outputs can affect downstream platform behavior, so model interaction MUST be structured, bounded, traceable, validated, and governed.

The protocol exists to ensure that:

* models are invoked through formal requests rather than informal prompts
* every model call is associated with a task, agent role, output contract, and context package
* model calls remain within the active Construction Boundary and authorized Connection Contexts
* requests are provider-neutral
* responses are normalized before platform use
* responses are validated before downstream consumption
* invalid responses trigger correction, retry, fallback, escalation, or rejection
* model outputs do not bypass deterministic validation
* sensitive context is controlled
* local and remote model providers use the same logical protocol
* model interaction evidence remains auditable

---

## 3.0 Protocol Design Principles

### 3.1 Structured Reasoning Transactions

Every model interaction MUST be treated as a structured reasoning transaction.

A transaction MUST have a request envelope, response envelope, output contract, context reference, selected model profile, validation status, and traceability links.

### 3.2 Model-Agnostic Protocol

The protocol MUST be independent of any specific model provider, runtime, API, SDK, message format, or deployment topology.

Provider adapters MAY translate the protocol into provider-specific calls, but the platform-facing request and response contracts MUST remain provider-neutral.

### 3.3 Agent-Bounded Invocation

A model interaction MUST be framed by an agent role or authorized platform reasoning role.

The agent role defines the purpose, permitted behavior, required context, and output contract. The model supplies reasoning capability but MUST NOT redefine the agent role.

### 3.4 Context Minimization

A model request MUST include only the context necessary for the task.

The platform MUST NOT include unrelated specification, artifact, governance, telemetry, secret, or user data in model context.

Context minimization MUST respect Construction Boundaries. A context package MUST NOT include prior boundary state, unrelated reusable assets, or adjacent implementation details unless an active Connection Context authorizes that transfer.

### 3.5 Output Contract Enforcement

Every model request MUST declare an output contract.

A model response MUST NOT be accepted unless it satisfies the declared output contract or enters an explicit correction, review, waiver, or escalation path.

### 3.6 Deterministic Follow-Up

A model response MUST NOT be treated as final merely because it was generated.

Model outputs that affect artifacts, validation, security, governance, deployment, or lifecycle state MUST be followed by deterministic validation, repository admission, governance checks, or human review as applicable.

### 3.7 Traceability and Auditability

Every model interaction that affects construction, review, validation, repair, governance, or deployment preparation MUST be traceable to the task, agent role, context package, model profile, output contract, response validation result, and downstream action.

---

## 4.0 Reasoning Transaction Lifecycle

A model interaction follows a defined lifecycle.

| Stage                 | Purpose                                              |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| requested             | Agent or runtime requests model reasoning            |
| context-bound         | Context package is selected and controlled           |
| contract-bound        | Output contract is selected                          |
| model-routed          | Model router selects model provider and profile      |
| governance-checked    | Governance controls are evaluated when required      |
| invocation-dispatched | Request is sent through provider adapter             |
| response-received     | Raw response is received                             |
| normalized            | Raw response is converted into platform output form  |
| validated             | Normalized output is checked against output contract |
| accepted              | Valid response is accepted for downstream handling   |
| corrected             | Response correction requested                        |
| retried               | Request retried under retry policy                   |
| fallback-routed       | Request routed to alternate model                    |
| escalated             | Human or governance intervention required            |
| rejected              | Response rejected and not used                       |
| completed             | Transaction closed                                   |

### 4.1 Lifecycle Rules

A transaction MUST NOT enter invocation-dispatched until context-bound, contract-bound, and model-routed stages are complete.

A governed transaction MUST NOT enter invocation-dispatched until governance permits the invocation.

A transaction MUST NOT enter accepted state unless response validation passes or a valid governance waiver permits manual acceptance.

A rejected response MUST NOT be consumed by downstream platform components.

### 5.2 Request Envelope Rules

A request MUST include agent-role, task-id, context-package-id, output-contract-id, selected-model-profile-id, and correlation-id.

A request MUST identify specification-id and specification-version.

A request MUST declare timeout-seconds.

A request MUST declare sensitivity-classification.

A request for artifact generation, repair, planning, or review MUST declare construction-boundary-id when the task is boundary-scoped.

A request that depends on context outside the active Construction Boundary MUST declare valid connection-context-ids.

A request constrained by a Reuse Decision Record MUST declare reuse-decision-id and MUST state whether the model may generate full artifact content, reuse only, reuse-delta, wrapper, extension, or composition output.

A request MUST NOT include raw secrets.

A request MUST NOT include provider-specific fields except inside adapter-private metadata not visible to agent or runtime contracts.

---

## 6.0 Context Package Reference

The request envelope references a context package rather than embedding uncontrolled context.

### 6.2 Context Package Rules

The context package MUST be assembled before model invocation.

The context package MUST be controlled for sensitivity, redaction, relevance, and size.

The model request MUST reference context-package-id.

Restricted context MUST NOT be sent to a model whose trust profile disallows restricted context.

Context that contains secrets MUST block invocation unless explicitly permitted by governance.

An expired, superseded, missing, or policy-incompatible Connection Context MUST block invocation.

The context package SHOULD provide summaries, selectors, and minimal asset metadata before full artifact content when the selected model profile is local, low-memory, or otherwise resource-constrained.

The platform MUST record a boundary drift finding when the assembled context includes information outside the active boundary without an authorizing Connection Context.

---

## 7.0 Instruction Structure

The instruction structure defines how a request is framed for the model.

### 7.1 Required Instruction Sections

An instruction template MUST include:

| Section                   | Required | Purpose                                                            |

| failure-behavior          | YES      | Defines what to return if unable to comply                         |

### 7.2 Instruction Rules

Instructions MUST distinguish platform instructions from untrusted context.

Instructions MUST identify the required output contract.

Instructions MUST direct the model to return only the requested output format when machine parsing is required.

Instructions MUST NOT invite the model to alter role, governance, validation, or traceability requirements.

If the model cannot satisfy the request, the instruction MUST require a structured failure response.

---

## 8.0 Output Contract Model

An output contract defines the response shape, validation rules, and downstream handling requirements.

### 8.2 Output Contract Rules

Every model request MUST reference an active output contract.

A revoked or disabled output contract MUST NOT be used.

A model response MUST be validated against the exact output contract version used in the request.

A breaking contract change MUST increment major version.

A response that omits required traceability fields MUST fail validation.

---

## 11.0 Output Normalization

Output normalization converts raw model output into the declared contract structure.

### 11.1 Normalization Steps

The platform MUST:

1. Retrieve raw provider response.
2. Identify expected output contract.
3. Extract structured payload.
4. Remove irrelevant provider wrapper text.
5. Parse required format.
6. Map provider-specific fields to platform fields.
7. Preserve raw response reference if retention policy permits.
8. Produce normalized output reference.
9. Record normalization findings.

### 11.2 Normalization Record Schema

| Field                           | Type     | Required    | Description                      |

| normalized-by                   | string   | REQUIRED    | Normalizer component             |

### 11.3 Normalization Rules

A response MUST be normalized before platform consumption.

Partial normalization MUST NOT be accepted unless the output contract permits partial output.

Normalization failure MUST trigger correction, retry, fallback, escalation, or rejection.

---

## 12.0 Response Validation

Response validation checks normalized output against the output contract.

### 12.1 Validation Checks

The platform MUST check:

* output contract version match
* required field presence
* prohibited field absence
* field type correctness
* enum value correctness
* required traceability identifiers
* referenced entity existence
* referenced artifact existence where applicable
* reuse decision compliance where applicable
* reusable asset reference validity where applicable
* task compatibility
* agent role compatibility
* Construction Boundary compatibility
* Connection Context compatibility
* security and sensitivity constraints
* deterministic follow-up flag correctness
* downstream consumer compatibility

### 12.2 Response Validation Record Schema

| Field                         | Type     | Required    | Description                                                      |
| ----------------------------- | -------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| response-validation-id        | string   | REQUIRED    | Unique validation record                                         |

| next-action                   | enum     | REQUIRED    | accept, correct, retry, fallback, human-review, escalate, reject |

### 12.3 Validation Rules

A response MUST NOT be accepted unless validation passes, warning is accepted under policy, or waiver exists.

A response missing required traceability identifiers MUST fail validation.

A response that exceeds the agent role boundary MUST fail validation.

A response containing prohibited content MUST be rejected or escalated.

A response that introduces entities, dependencies, assumptions, artifacts, or policies outside the active Construction Boundary without valid Connection Context authority MUST fail validation.

A response that proposes full generation where a Reuse Decision Record authorizes reuse, reuse-delta, wrapper, extension, or composition only MUST fail validation.

---

## 13.0 Correction Requests

A correction request asks the same model to repair its response format or missing fields without changing task scope.

### 13.1 Correction Request Preconditions

Correction MAY be attempted only when:

* output contract allows correction
* original request is valid
* failure is limited to correctable structure, missing field, formatting, or minor ambiguity
* retry policy permits correction
* governance does not require escalation

### 13.2 Correction Request Schema

| Field                                 | Type     | Required | Description                    |
| ------------------------------------- | -------- | -------- | ------------------------------ |

| original-model-interaction-request-id | string   | REQUIRED | Original request               |
| failed-response-validation-id         | string   | REQUIRED | Failed validation              |
| correction-reason                     | string   | REQUIRED | Reason correction is requested |
| failed-rules                          | array    | REQUIRED | Rules to correct               |

| requested-at                          | ISO 8601 | REQUIRED | Request time                   |

### 13.3 Correction Rules

Correction MUST NOT change the task objective.

Correction MUST NOT add new context except validation findings and correction instructions.

Correction attempts MUST be bounded.

Correction failure MUST trigger retry, fallback, escalation, or rejection.

---

## 14.0 Retry and Fallback Behavior

The protocol supports retry and fallback, but both MUST be controlled.

### 14.1 Retry Rules

Retry MAY occur when:

* provider timeout occurred
* provider unavailable
* response incomplete
* output malformed
* transient routing or adapter failure occurred

Retry MUST NOT occur when:

* governance blocks model use
* context violates policy
* output contains security violation requiring escalation
* requested model lacks required capability
* retry limit has been reached

### 14.2 Fallback Rules

Fallback MAY occur only when:

* routing policy permits fallback
* eligible fallback model exists
* fallback model satisfies required capabilities
* fallback model trust profile permits the context sensitivity
* governance permits fallback provider
* output contract remains unchanged or compatible

### 14.3 Retry and Fallback Limits

| Parameter                                         |                       Default |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------: |
| Maximum correction attempts per response          |                             2 |
| Maximum retry attempts per request                |                             3 |
| Maximum fallback attempts per request             |                             2 |
| Escalation threshold for repeated invalid outputs | 3 consecutive invalid outputs |

### 14.4 Retry/Fallback Rules

Retry and fallback attempts MUST be recorded.

Retry and fallback MUST preserve correlation identifiers.

Fallback MUST produce or amend routing decision records.

Repeated invalid outputs MUST escalate.

---

## 15.0 Deterministic Follow-Up

Model outputs that affect platform state require deterministic follow-up.

### 15.1 Required Follow-Up by Output Type

| Output Type            | Required Follow-Up                                         |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| artifact-candidate     | Artifact Repository admission and deterministic validation |
| repair-proposal        | Repair task creation and revalidation after modification   |
| test-plan              | Test artifact generation and test execution                |
| review-finding         | Finding classification and governed handling               |
| security-finding       | Security policy evaluation and governance routing          |
| deployment-preparation | Manifest validation and operational readiness checks       |
| plan-fragment          | Planning validation and dependency validation              |
| interpretation         | Canonical model or task consistency checks                 |

### 15.2 Follow-Up Rules

A model output MUST NOT directly promote artifacts.

A model output MUST NOT directly mark validation passed.

A model output MUST NOT directly approve governance gates.

A model output MUST NOT directly authorize deployment.

Deterministic follow-up MUST be recorded as linked evidence.

Model interaction MUST obey governance policy.

### 16.1 Governed Model Interaction Actions

Governance MAY control:

* external model provider use
* restricted context transmission
* experimental model use
* fallback to weaker trust profile
* security task model use
* High or Critical risk model interaction
* raw response retention
* human review bypass
* response waiver
* model-generated artifact acceptance

### 16.2 Governance Rules

A governance block MUST prevent invocation.

An approval-required decision MUST pause invocation.

A waiver-required decision MUST prevent acceptance until waiver exists.

A model interaction involving restricted context MUST be governed when policy requires it.

Governance decisions MUST be recorded and linked to the model transaction.

---

## 17.0 Security and Prompt Injection Controls

The protocol MUST protect model interaction from malicious or untrusted context.

### 17.1 Required Controls

The platform MUST:

* classify context sensitivity
* separate platform instructions from untrusted context
* mark untrusted context explicitly
* prevent untrusted content from redefining role, output contract, governance, or validation rules
* redact secrets
* block unauthorized restricted context
* record prompt or context injection findings
* reject outputs that attempt governance, traceability, validation, or role bypass

---

## 27.0 Summary

ISL v3.8 defines the Model Interaction Protocol for the ALETHEIA platform. It establishes the formal protocol through which agents and runtime services interact with reasoning models.

This revision turns the prior conceptual protocol into an implementable contract. It defines reasoning transaction lifecycle, request envelopes, response envelopes, context package references, instruction structure, output contracts, standard output types, normalization, validation, correction, retry, fallback, deterministic follow-up, governance, security, streaming, batch interaction, traceability, telemetry, records, retention, error classes, versioning, testing, and conformance.

A conforming Model Interaction Protocol MUST make model reasoning structured, bounded, provider-neutral, context-controlled, output-contracted, normalized, validated, traceable, governable, secure, observable, and unable to bypass deterministic platform controls.
