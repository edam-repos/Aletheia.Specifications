## 1.0 Scope

This document defines the Runtime Orchestration Architecture for the ALETHEIA reference implementation. It specifies how runtime services, workers, agents, tools, queues, state stores, artifact repositories, governance controls, traceability records, and telemetry systems are coordinated during autonomous construction.

This document applies to the implementation architecture of runtime orchestration. ISL v2.4 defines the normative execution runtime model. This document defines the reference architecture that realizes that model in implementation form.

This document defines:

* runtime orchestration responsibilities
* orchestrator components
* orchestration service boundaries
* task graph execution
* scheduling and dispatch
* queue and work item orchestration
* worker orchestration
* agent orchestration
* tool orchestration
* artifact orchestration
* validation orchestration
* repair orchestration
* event-driven orchestration
* parallel execution orchestration
* governance orchestration
* recovery orchestration
* observability requirements
* conformance requirements

---

## 2.0 Purpose

The purpose of the Runtime Orchestration Architecture is to define how the ALETHEIA platform coordinates active construction work. The runtime orchestrator is the implementation control center that turns an executable construction task graph into ordered, governed, observable, recoverable work.

The runtime orchestrator does not replace the Planning Engine, Agent Orchestrator, Tool Gateway, Artifact Service, Traceability Service, Governance Service, State Manager, or Telemetry Service. Instead, it coordinates those components through controlled contracts.

The Runtime Orchestration Architecture exists to ensure that:

* task graph execution is ordered and deterministic where required
* task eligibility is evaluated consistently
* agents and tools are invoked only through authorized paths
* artifacts are admitted and promoted through repository controls
* validation failures trigger bounded repair behavior
* runtime state remains durable and recoverable
* parallel work does not corrupt artifacts, state, or traceability
* governance gates pause and resume execution through explicit signals
* telemetry shows runtime behavior without replacing state or audit records
* runtime orchestration can scale from local execution to distributed worker pools

---

## 3.0 Runtime Orchestration Principles

### 3.1 The Orchestrator Coordinates but Does Not Own All Work

The runtime orchestrator MUST coordinate execution but MUST NOT absorb the responsibilities of other platform services.

The orchestrator MUST call the Agent Orchestrator for agent work, the Tool Gateway for deterministic tool work, the Artifact Service for artifact lifecycle work, the Governance Service for governed decisions, the Traceability Service for traceability writes, and the State Manager for state transitions.

### 3.2 Task Graph Is the Source of Runtime Work

The orchestrator MUST execute work derived from a valid Construction Task Graph.

The orchestrator MUST NOT create arbitrary construction work that is not represented as a task, validation obligation, repair obligation, governance action, repository action, recovery action, or lifecycle action.

### 3.3 Runtime State Is Authoritative

The orchestrator MUST make scheduling and continuation decisions from durable runtime state.

In-memory scheduler state MAY be used for efficiency but MUST NOT be the sole source of truth.

### 3.4 Governance Is a Control Signal

Governance decisions MUST directly affect orchestration. A block, approval-required, waiver-required, override-required, or escalation decision MUST pause, stop, or route execution according to the decision.

### 3.5 Events Trigger Work, State Controls Work

The orchestration architecture MAY be event-driven. However, events MUST NOT bypass state validation. An event may trigger scheduling evaluation, but the current state MUST determine whether work is eligible.

### 3.6 Concurrency Requires Isolation

Parallel execution MUST be permitted only when dependencies, locks, leases, artifact paths, governance constraints, and resource limits allow it.

### 3.7 Recovery Is an Orchestration Responsibility

The orchestrator MUST detect interrupted, ambiguous, expired, or inconsistent runtime work and coordinate recovery before resuming dispatch.

8. Admit revised artifact.
9. Revalidate revised artifact.
10. Record repair outcome.
11. Continue, escalate, or fail.

### 17.2 Repair Limits

| Limit                                                 |                Default |

## 18.0 Event-Driven Orchestration

The runtime orchestration architecture MAY use events to trigger work.

### 18.1 Runtime Event Types

| Event                        | Triggered By                    |

The orchestrator MUST pause dependent tasks when prerequisite tasks fail.

The orchestrator MAY continue unrelated tasks after a local failure when governance and runtime policy permit it.

Parallel execution MUST not weaken validation or traceability requirements.

---

## 20.0 Governance Orchestration

Governance orchestration integrates approvals, waivers, overrides, policy checks, and escalations into runtime execution.

### 20.1 Governance Orchestration Points

The orchestrator MUST consult governance before:

* execution start
* governed task dispatch
* restricted model use
* restricted tool use
* high-risk artifact generation

---

## 30.0 Summary

ISL v3.5 defines the Runtime Orchestration Architecture for the ALETHEIA reference implementation. It explains how the runtime acts as the construction coordinator that transforms an executable construction plan into governed, traceable, validated, recoverable work.

This revision strengthens the original runtime orchestration concept by making the orchestration architecture implementable. It defines orchestrator components, service boundaries, admission, execution graph management, eligibility evaluation, scheduling, queueing, dispatch, worker coordination, leases, locks, agent orchestration, tool orchestration, artifact orchestration, validation, bounded repair, event-driven behavior, parallel execution, governance pause/resume behavior, recovery, completion, state records, telemetry, security, errors, operating modes, testing, and conformance requirements.

A conforming Runtime Orchestration Architecture MUST coordinate autonomous construction without becoming an uncontrolled monolith. It MUST be the construction foreman: scheduling the work, assigning the workforce, enforcing safety, recording progress, responding to failure, calling inspections, and stopping the worksite when evidence or governance says the system is not ready.
