# ALETHEIA Specification Language (ISL) v2.5

# The Model Integration and Abstraction Layer

**Status:** Normative
**Release:** r2
**Depends On:** ISL v0.0, ISL v1.1, ISL v1.2, ISL v1.4, ISL v1.7, ISL v2.0, ISL v2.1, ISL v2.2, ISL v2.4
**Supersedes:** ISL r0 v2.5 The Model Integration and Abstraction Layer
**Document Type:** Model Provider, Routing, and Interaction Abstraction Specification

---

## 1.0 Scope

This document defines the Model Integration and Abstraction Layer for the ALETHEIA platform. It establishes how reasoning agents obtain model capabilities through a standardized, provider-neutral interface.

This document applies to all model interactions used for specification interpretation, architecture planning, construction planning, implementation generation, repair analysis, test generation, review, security validation, deployment preparation, and other model-assisted reasoning activities.

This document defines:

* model provider abstraction
* local-first model strategy
* model provider registration
* model capability declaration
* model capability validation
* model selection and routing
* model invocation contracts
* context packaging and context control
* structured output requirements
* output normalization
* model failure handling
* fallback behavior
* governance and policy enforcement
* traceability and auditability
* telemetry and observability
* model lifecycle management
* conformance requirements

---

## 2.0 Purpose of the Model Integration and Abstraction Layer

The purpose of the Model Integration and Abstraction Layer is to isolate the ALETHEIA platform and its agents from dependency on any specific model provider, model runtime, model architecture, or model API. Agents require reasoning capability, but they MUST NOT depend directly on a particular provider interface.

This layer provides the controlled boundary through which agents request reasoning services. It allows the platform to use local models, enterprise-hosted models, cloud-hosted models, specialized coding models, review models, security models, or hybrid model configurations without changing the agent contracts or execution runtime.

The Model Integration and Abstraction Layer exists to ensure that:

* models are used through a standard platform contract
* provider-specific logic is isolated behind adapters
* model usage remains local-first where configured
* model capabilities are declared explicitly
* routing decisions are explainable and auditable
* context exposure is controlled by governance and sensitivity rules
* model outputs are normalized before downstream use
* model failures have defined handling paths
* model interactions are traceable to tasks, agents, artifacts, and decisions
* model providers can evolve without destabilizing platform architecture

**Model Adapter**
A provider-specific implementation that translates platform model requests into provider-specific invocations and normalizes provider responses.

**Model Integration Layer**
The platform subsystem that registers model providers, validates model capabilities, routes requests, invokes models, normalizes outputs, and enforces model governance.

**Model Capability**
A declared ability of a model, such as code generation, structured output, long-context reasoning, repair analysis, security review, or test generation.

**Model Profile**
A structured record describing a model, its capabilities, constraints, cost, context limits, trust level, supported output formats, and provider relationship.

**Routing Policy**
A rule set used to select a model for an agent invocation.

**Model Invocation**
A structured request to a model through the abstraction layer.

**Model Invocation Result**

**Fallback Model**
An alternative model selected when the primary model is unavailable, fails, times out, violates policy, or fails output validation.

---

## 5.0 Design Principles

### 5.1 Provider Neutrality

Agents MUST interact with models only through the Model Integration and Abstraction Layer. Agents MUST NOT directly invoke local runtimes, remote APIs, provider SDKs, or provider-specific prompt interfaces.

### 5.2 Local-First Operation

The platform MUST be capable of operating with locally hosted or locally available models where the deployment profile requires local-first operation. External models MAY be used only when governance and configuration permit them.

### 5.3 Explicit Capability Declaration

Model capabilities MUST be declared explicitly. The platform MUST NOT infer capabilities from model names, provider branding, marketing descriptions, or informal labels.

### 5.4 Capability-Based Routing

The platform MUST select models based on declared capabilities, task requirements, agent role, context requirements, governance constraints, and runtime policy.

### 5.5 Context Minimization

The platform MUST provide models only the context required for the invocation. Context assembly MUST respect sensitivity, governance, risk tier, and provider restrictions.

### 5.6 Structured Output Preference

Model invocations SHOULD use structured output contracts when downstream platform components will interpret the result automatically.

### 5.7 Runtime-Governed Model Use

Restricted model use MUST be governed at runtime. A model invocation MUST NOT proceed when governance returns block, approval-required, waiver-required, override-required, or escalate.

### 5.8 Traceable Reasoning

Every model invocation that contributes to planning, generation, review, repair, security validation, deployment preparation, governance support, or artifact creation MUST be traceable.

---

## 6.0 Model Integration Architecture

The Model Integration and Abstraction Layer is the controlled interface between agents and model providers.

### 6.1 Logical Components

| Fallback Manager          | Selects alternate models when permitted                                    |
| Telemetry Emitter         | Emits model interaction telemetry                                          |
| Traceability Connector    | Records model invocation links to tasks, agents, outputs, and decisions    |

### 6.2 Architectural Rules

All model invocations MUST pass through the Model Integration Layer.

Provider-specific credentials, SDKs, endpoints, and runtime details MUST be isolated inside provider adapters or controlled configuration.

The Model Router MUST NOT select models that are not registered, not active, or not permitted by governance.

The Output Normalizer MUST validate model output before downstream platform use.

|---|---|---|
| model-invocation-result-id | string | REQUIRED | Unique result identifier |
| model-invocation-id | string | REQUIRED | Invocation request |
| agent-invocation-id | string | REQUIRED | Agent invocation |
| selected-model-profile-id | string | REQUIRED | Model used |
| selected-provider-id | string | REQUIRED | Provider used |
| outcome | enum | REQUIRED | completed, failed, timeout, cancelled, blocked, normalized, invalid-output |

| provider-status | string | CONDITIONAL | Provider-specific status normalized as metadata |
| completed-at | ISO 8601 | REQUIRED | Completion time |
| next-action | enum | REQUIRED | accept, normalize, retry, fallback, escalate, reject, halt |

### 17.2 Result Rules

A timeout MUST NOT be treated as completed.

An invalid-output outcome MUST NOT be accepted for downstream agent output use.

A result with output-validation-status failed MUST trigger retry, fallback, escalation, or rejection.

Raw output retention MUST follow governance and sensitivity rules.

---

## 18.0 Context Control

The Model Integration Layer MUST enforce context rules before invocation.

### 18.1 Context Control Checks

Before invocation, the Context Controller MUST verify:

* context-package-id exists
* context was assembled for the requesting agent role
* active Construction Boundary is identified where required
* required Connection Contexts are valid where boundary crossing occurs
* Reuse Decision Records constrain generation mode where applicable
* context sensitivity is compatible with selected provider and model
* context size fits selected model limits
* required entities and records are present
* excluded context is documented
* secrets are not present unless explicitly authorized
* untrusted content is marked or isolated
* governance constraints are included
* provider data retention profile is compatible with context sensitivity
* context is minimized for selected model profile, especially local or resource-constrained models

### 18.2 Context Control Record Schema

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| context-control-id | string | REQUIRED | Unique context control record |
| context-package-id | string | REQUIRED | Context package evaluated |

| evaluated-at | ISO 8601 | REQUIRED | Evaluation time |
| evaluated-by | string | REQUIRED | Context Controller |

### 18.3 Context Control Rules

Context control MUST pass before model invocation.

A context package containing unauthorized secrets MUST block invocation.

A restricted context package MUST NOT be routed to a model or provider whose trust profile disallows restricted context.

An invocation that crosses a Construction Boundary MUST NOT proceed unless valid Connection Contexts authorize the crossing.

An invocation constrained by a Reuse Decision Record MUST NOT request full artifact generation unless the decision authorizes full generation.

For local or resource-constrained model profiles, the Context Controller SHOULD prefer minimized summaries, selectors, and reusable asset metadata over broad artifact history whenever those representations satisfy the role contract.

If redaction changes required context, the invocation MUST be rejected or escalated unless the role contract accepts redacted context.

---

## 19.0 Structured Interaction and Output Contracts

A model selected for structured output SHOULD support the required output format natively or through reliable adapter normalization.

A model response that does not satisfy the output contract MUST be rejected, retried, normalized if safe, or escalated.

Output contract versions MUST be recorded in model invocation records.

---

## 34.0 Summary

ISL v2.5 defines the Model Integration and Abstraction Layer for the ALETHEIA platform. It establishes how agents obtain reasoning capability through registered, governed, provider-neutral model interfaces.

This revision strengthens the original model integration concept by making provider registration, model profiles, capability declaration, capability validation, routing policies, model selection, context control, invocation contracts, output contracts, normalization, retry, fallback, governance, traceability, telemetry, lifecycle management, and error handling explicit.

A conforming ALETHEIA platform MUST treat models as governed reasoning resources, not direct dependencies. Models may interpret, generate, review, repair, and reason, but they MUST do so through controlled abstraction, declared capability, governed context, structured output, traceable invocation, and runtime validation.
