## 1.0 Scope

This document defines the Observability and Telemetry Model for the ALETHEIA platform. It establishes how platform activity is measured, emitted, correlated, stored, queried, visualized, alerted, retained, protected, and used for operational understanding.

This document applies to all observable activity across specification processing, canonical normalization, readiness evaluation, construction planning, runtime execution, agent collaboration, model invocation, deterministic tool invocation, artifact lifecycle management, validation, repair, governance, traceability, repository operations, deployment preparation, recovery, and platform health.

This document defines:

* observability principles
* telemetry categories
* telemetry event schema
* trace, metric, and log requirements
* correlation identifiers
* execution telemetry
* agent telemetry
* model telemetry
* tool telemetry
* artifact telemetry
* governance telemetry
* traceability telemetry
* state and recovery telemetry
* performance and resource telemetry
* dashboards and alerting
* telemetry storage and retention
* privacy and security controls
* OpenTelemetry alignment
* conformance requirements

## 2.0 Purpose of the Observability and Telemetry Model

The purpose of the Observability and Telemetry Model is to ensure that autonomous construction is visible, measurable, explainable, and operationally manageable. Autonomous software construction involves many interacting subsystems: specifications, semantic models, planning engines, runtime workers, reasoning agents, deterministic tools, governance policies, artifact repositories, model providers, and traceability graphs. Without observability, the platform would be difficult to operate safely.

Observability provides the operational evidence required to understand what happened, what is happening, and what may require intervention. It allows operators to detect blocked tasks, failing tools, repeated repair cycles, model failures, governance bottlenecks, repository conflicts, performance degradation, and abnormal behavior.

The Observability and Telemetry Model exists to ensure that:

* platform activity can be monitored in real time
* execution history can be reconstructed
* failures can be diagnosed
* performance and resource usage can be measured
* governance effects can be observed
* agent and model behavior can be evaluated
* deterministic validation outcomes can be analyzed
* operational dashboards can support human oversight
* telemetry can support continuous improvement without replacing audit or traceability records

---

## 5.0 Observability Design Principles

### 5.1 Observability Is Core Platform Capability

Observability MUST be integrated into platform subsystems. It MUST NOT be treated as optional debugging instrumentation.

Every major lifecycle action SHOULD emit telemetry sufficient to monitor execution and diagnose failures.

### 5.2 Telemetry Is Not Audit

Telemetry supports monitoring and diagnostics. It MUST NOT replace immutable governance audit logs, traceability records, artifact metadata, validation evidence, or state records.

Where an action is audit-relevant, both telemetry and audit/state records MAY exist, but the audit/state record remains authoritative.

### 5.3 Correlation Is Mandatory

Telemetry emitted by platform subsystems MUST include correlation identifiers sufficient to connect events to specifications, plans, executions, tasks, artifacts, agents, tools, models, governance checks, and traceability records where applicable.

Uncorrelated telemetry SHOULD be treated as degraded observability.

### 5.4 Structured Telemetry Is Required

Telemetry used for monitoring, alerting, dashboards, or automated analysis MUST be structured.

Free-form logs MAY exist, but they MUST NOT be the only telemetry source for lifecycle-critical operations.

### 5.5 Observability Must Preserve Security

Telemetry MUST NOT leak secrets, restricted context, sensitive artifacts, raw model prompts, confidential policy data, credentials, or regulated data unless explicitly authorized by governance.

Sensitive telemetry MUST be classified, protected, retained, and accessed according to policy.

### 5.6 Telemetry Must Be Actionable

Telemetry SHOULD support operational action. Events, metrics, logs, and alerts SHOULD identify affected targets, severity, likely cause, and remediation path when determinable.

### 5.7 OpenTelemetry Alignment

A conforming platform SHOULD align telemetry concepts with OpenTelemetry traces, metrics, logs, attributes, resources, context propagation, and semantic conventions.

Where ISL defines domain-specific attributes, implementations SHOULD map them into OpenTelemetry-compatible attributes where possible.

---

## 6.0 Observability Architecture

This section defines the logical observability architecture.

### 6.1 Logical Components

| Component           | Responsibility                                                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Telemetry Emitter   | Emits structured telemetry from platform subsystems           |
| Telemetry Collector | Receives telemetry from emitters                              |
| Telemetry Processor | Normalizes, enriches, filters, samples, and redacts telemetry |
| Telemetry Store     | Persists telemetry events, logs, metrics, and traces          |
| Metrics Engine      | Aggregates and calculates metrics                             |
| Trace Engine        | Correlates spans across subsystems                            |
| Log Store           | Stores structured and diagnostic logs                         |
| Alert Engine        | Evaluates alert rules                                         |
| Dashboard Service   | Provides visual operational views                             |
| Exporter            | Sends telemetry to external observability systems             |
| Policy Filter       | Applies redaction, access, retention, and export controls     |

### 6.2 Architecture Rules

Every platform subsystem SHOULD emit telemetry through the Telemetry Emitter or equivalent interface.

Telemetry processors MUST apply classification and redaction rules before export.

Telemetry storage MUST preserve correlation identifiers.

Alert evaluation MUST use structured telemetry or metrics.

Telemetry export MUST obey governance and sensitivity rules.

### 7.1 Signal Rules

A lifecycle transition SHOULD emit an event.

A long-running operation SHOULD emit a trace and spans.

Repeated measurements SHOULD be represented as metrics.

Human-readable diagnostic details MAY be logs, but lifecycle state MUST be represented structurally.

Worker liveness SHOULD be represented through heartbeat telemetry.

---

## 33.0 Summary

ISL v2.6 defines the Observability and Telemetry Model for the ALETHEIA platform. It establishes how telemetry is emitted, structured, correlated, stored, queried, visualized, alerted, retained, protected, exported, and aligned with OpenTelemetry.

This revision strengthens the original observability model by turning general visibility concepts into explicit operational contracts. It defines telemetry schemas, signal types, traces, metrics, logs, correlation identifiers, domain-specific telemetry categories, alert rules, dashboards, retention, redaction, access control, export, telemetry quality, and conformance requirements.

A conforming ALETHEIA platform MUST make autonomous construction observable without confusing telemetry with audit or traceability. Telemetry shows platform behavior; audit proves governance history; traceability proves derivation. Together, they make autonomous construction transparent, governable, diagnosable, and continuously improvable.
