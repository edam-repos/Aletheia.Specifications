## 1.0 Scope

This document defines the architecture of the ALETHEIA platform: the system responsible for interpreting ISL specifications, normalizing them into canonical semantic models, generating construction plans, orchestrating agents, invoking deterministic tools, managing artifacts, preserving traceability, enforcing governance, and supporting autonomous software construction.

This document applies to conforming implementations of the ALETHEIA platform. It defines required platform subsystems, subsystem responsibilities, architectural boundaries, data flow rules, control points, integration contracts, runtime coordination responsibilities, and conformance expectations. It does not prescribe a specific programming language, cloud provider, database, model provider, operating system, or deployment topology. Those are implementation choices, provided the resulting platform satisfies this architecture.

This document defines:

* platform architecture principles
* core platform subsystems
* subsystem responsibility boundaries
* subsystem interface expectations
* platform data flows
* governance and traceability integration
* tool and model abstraction boundaries
* artifact repository responsibilities
* observability and monitoring expectations
* local-first and enterprise scalability requirements
* conformance requirements

---

## 2.0 Purpose of the Platform Architecture Model

The purpose of the Platform Architecture Model is to define the structural organization of the ALETHEIA platform itself. Earlier ISL documents define how systems are specified, validated, planned, traced, governed, and executed. This document defines the architecture of the platform that performs those activities.

The ALETHEIA platform is not merely an authoring tool, a code generator, or an agent orchestration framework. It is an autonomous construction environment that coordinates formal specifications, canonical semantic models, task graphs, reasoning agents, deterministic tools, artifact repositories, governance services, and observability systems. Its architecture must therefore provide strong subsystem boundaries and explicit control paths.

This architecture exists to ensure that:

* ISL specifications are processed consistently
* semantic interpretation is separated from execution
* planning is traceable to canonical specification entities
* agents operate under runtime and governance control
* generated artifacts are validated deterministically
* repair cycles are bounded and auditable
* governance is enforced continuously
* traceability is preserved across the lifecycle
* platform behavior can be observed, audited, and scaled

## 5.0 Platform Architecture Design Principles

This section defines the design principles that govern the ALETHEIA platform architecture. These principles ensure the platform remains modular, auditable, secure, scalable, and adaptable.

### 5.1 Layered Architecture

The platform MUST be organized as a layered architecture with clear responsibility boundaries. Each subsystem MUST perform a defined architectural role and MUST NOT bypass other subsystems’ control responsibilities.

Layering ensures that specification processing, semantic normalization, planning, execution, validation, governance, traceability, and artifact storage remain understandable and independently evolvable.

### 5.2 Specification-Driven Operation

The platform MUST operate from ISL specifications and their canonical semantic models. Construction activity MUST NOT be initiated from informal prompts, unnormalized prose, or ungoverned instructions.

The specification is the source of truth. The platform’s architecture MUST preserve this principle at every layer.

### 5.3 Local-First Capability

The platform MUST be capable of operating in a local-first mode using local infrastructure, local artifact repositories, local tools, and locally hosted or locally available model providers where configured.

Local-first operation supports privacy, restricted environments, offline development, enterprise experimentation, and operational independence.

### 5.4 Abstraction of External Dependencies

External model providers, deterministic tools, artifact repositories, identity systems, observability systems, and deployment environments MUST be integrated through abstraction layers.

The platform MUST NOT hardcode dependency-specific behavior into core orchestration or construction logic where an abstraction boundary is required.

### 5.5 Governed Autonomy

The platform MUST treat governance as an active control layer. Governance decisions MUST influence readiness, planning, execution, tool usage, repair, deployment preparation, and artifact acceptance.

A subsystem MUST NOT continue a governed action when the Governance Engine returns block, escalation, approval-required, waiver-required, or override-required.

### 5.6 Traceability by Construction

The platform MUST record traceability as actions occur. Traceability MUST NOT be treated as an optional report produced after execution.

Every construction task, generated artifact, validation result, repair action, governance event, and deployment preparation output MUST be traceable according to ISL v1.4.

### 5.7 Deterministic Validation Before Trust

Generated artifacts MUST NOT be accepted as valid until required deterministic validation has passed or a governance-approved waiver exists.

The platform architecture MUST ensure that reasoning outputs pass through validation and governance boundaries before acceptance.

### 5.8 Observability and Auditability

The platform MUST expose sufficient observability and audit records to explain what the system did, why it did it, what evidence supports the result, and which governance decisions were applied.

Operational transparency is required for enterprise adoption and trust.

## 6.0 Platform Architecture Overview

This section provides the high-level architecture of the ALETHEIA platform. The platform consists of cooperating subsystems that together implement the autonomous construction lifecycle.

Each subsystem has a bounded responsibility. Subsystems may be implemented as separate services, libraries, modules, processes, containers, or distributed components. The implementation form is not prescribed, but the logical architecture and control responsibilities are normative.

### 6.1 Core Platform Subsystems

The platform SHALL include the following core subsystems:

| Subsystem              | Primary Responsibility                                                               |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Specification Engine   | Intake, parse, validate, and manage authored specifications                          |
| Semantic Model Engine  | Normalize and manage canonical semantic models                                       |
| Planning Engine        | Generate and validate construction task graphs                                       |
| Agent Orchestrator     | Coordinate reasoning agents and model-backed reasoning tasks                         |
| Construction Engine    | Execute construction tasks and manage generation, validation, repair, and completion |
| Tool Integration Layer | Register, select, invoke, and normalize deterministic tools                          |
| Traceability Engine    | Maintain lifecycle traceability graph                                                |
| Governance Engine      | Enforce policies, approval gates, waivers, overrides, and runtime decisions          |
| Execution Monitor      | Observe execution, collect telemetry, expose operational state                       |
| Artifact Repository    | Store generated artifacts, metadata, versions, and evidence                          |
| Reusable Asset Registry | Catalog approved reusable assets, provenance, validation state, and dependency impact |

### 6.2 Subsystem Interaction Summary

At a high level, the platform operates as follows:

1. The Specification Engine receives an authored ISL specification.
2. The Semantic Model Engine normalizes the specification into the canonical model.
3. The Readiness process evaluates whether the specification may progress.
4. The Planning Engine generates a construction task graph.
5. The Planning Engine queries the Reusable Asset Registry for applicable reuse before generation.
6. The Governance Engine evaluates approval and policy constraints.
7. The Construction Engine executes the task graph.
8. The Agent Orchestrator invokes reasoning agents when reasoning or generation is required.
9. The Tool Integration Layer invokes deterministic tools for validation.
10. The Artifact Repository stores generated outputs and evidence.
11. The Reusable Asset Registry records promoted reusable assets where approved.
12. The Traceability Engine records relationships across all lifecycle objects.
13. The Execution Monitor records telemetry and operational state.

### 6.3 Architecture Rule

A conforming platform MUST preserve these logical responsibilities even if implementation packaging combines multiple subsystems into a single process or service.

* create traceability nodes and edges
* enforce traceability identifier rules
* associate artifacts with source specification entities
* record task, validation, repair, tool, model, and governance links
* create traceability snapshots

* preserve historical traceability across versions

### 16.2 Rules

Traceability MUST be recorded at lifecycle event time.

Untraced artifacts MUST NOT be accepted as stable outputs.

Execution completion MUST be blocked if required traceability is incomplete.

Traceability snapshots MUST be created at required lifecycle points.

---

## 17.0 Governance Engine

This section defines the Governance Engine. The Governance Engine enforces the governance and control model across readiness, planning, execution, tool usage, model usage, repair, waiver, override, deployment, and audit.

Governance is an active runtime control layer, not a passive approval record.

### 17.1 Responsibilities

The Governance Engine MUST:

* manage role assignments
* evaluate policies
* enforce violation responses
* manage approval gates
* assign or validate risk tiers
* enforce separation-of-duties rules
* manage waivers and overrides
* open and resolve escalations
* evaluate governance runtime checks
* authorize or block deployment
* record immutable audit events
* expose governance audit queries

### 17.2 Rules

The Governance Engine MUST return explicit decisions to runtime governance checks.

Runtime components MUST obey governance decisions.

Governance audit events MUST be immutable.

Expired approvals, waivers, or overrides MUST NOT authorize progression.

---

## 18.0 Execution Monitor

This section defines the Execution Monitor. The Execution Monitor provides visibility into platform activity, execution state, task progress, artifact generation, validation outcomes, tool performance, agent activity, governance events, and runtime health.

Observability is essential because autonomous construction must be explainable and controllable.

### 18.1 Responsibilities

The Execution Monitor MUST:

* collect execution telemetry
* collect agent invocation telemetry
* collect tool invocation telemetry
* collect governance telemetry
* collect artifact lifecycle events
* expose task and phase progress
* expose validation and repair status
* expose errors and escalations
* support dashboards or query interfaces
* support operational alerts where configured

### 18.2 Rules

The platform MUST record telemetry for major lifecycle events.

Telemetry MUST be correlated with execution, task, artifact, tool, model, and governance identifiers where applicable.

Telemetry does not replace audit logs or traceability records.

---

## 19.0 Artifact Repository

This section defines the Artifact Repository. The Artifact Repository stores generated outputs and related metadata produced during autonomous construction.

The Artifact Repository bridges autonomous generation and conventional software engineering practices by preserving source code, configuration, schemas, tests, contracts, infrastructure definitions, documentation, packages, and deployment materials.

### 19.1 Responsibilities

The Artifact Repository MUST:

* store generated artifacts
* store artifact metadata
* preserve artifact versions
* support repository organization by system, module, service, or artifact type
* support artifact status tracking
* preserve validation evidence or references
* preserve deployment preparation outputs
* support artifact retrieval by platform subsystems
* integrate with traceability records
* prevent stable acceptance of untraced artifacts

### 19.2 Artifact States

The repository MUST support artifact states including:

* pending
* valid
* failed
* repaired
* escalated
* waived
* non-deployable
* deprecated
* superseded

### 19.3 Rules

An artifact MUST NOT be marked stable unless it has required traceability and validation status.

Artifact version history MUST be preserved.

Superseded artifacts MUST remain available for audit or reconstruction where required.

---

## 20.0 Platform Data Flow

This section defines the primary data flows across the platform. Data flow clarity is required so that implementations do not bypass validation, governance, traceability, or artifact control boundaries.

### 20.1 Primary Data Flow

The standard platform data flow is:

1. Authored specification enters Specification Engine.
2. Parsed specification enters Semantic Model Engine.
3. Canonical model enters readiness evaluation.
4. Machine-Valid canonical model enters Planning Engine.
5. Construction Task Graph performs reuse discovery and records Reuse Decisions where applicable.
6. Construction Task Graph enters governance evaluation and execution handoff.
7. Execution Runtime initializes Execution Graph.
8. Agent Orchestrator produces reasoning outputs for authorized generation, delta generation, wrapping, extension, composition, and repair tasks.
9. Artifact outputs enter Artifact Repository with pending status.
10. Tool Integration Layer validates artifacts.
11. Validation results update execution, traceability, and governance state.
12. Repair cycles update artifacts and validation records.
13. Consolidated artifacts enter stable repository state.
14. Approved reusable assets enter or update the Reusable Asset Registry.
15. Deployment preparation artifacts are generated and validated.
16. Completion report, traceability snapshot, and governance evidence are stored.

### 20.2 Data Flow Rules

The platform MUST NOT allow artifact generation before required readiness, reuse discovery, and governance conditions are met.

The platform MUST NOT allow artifact acceptance before traceability and validation requirements are satisfied.

The platform MUST NOT allow deployment authorization without governance approval.

The platform MUST preserve evidence and traceability across data flow boundaries.

---

## 21.0 Control Boundaries

This section defines the architecture’s control boundaries. Control boundaries prevent one subsystem from bypassing another subsystem’s responsibilities.

### 21.1 Required Control Boundaries

| Boundary                                          | Control Requirement                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Authored Specification → Canonical Model          | Must pass parsing and normalization                 |
| Canonical Model → Readiness                       | Must pass semantic validation                       |
| Machine-Valid → Planning                          | Must satisfy planning permissions                   |
| Plan → Execution                                  | Must pass planning validation and governance checks |
| Agent Output → Artifact Acceptance                | Must pass deterministic validation where applicable |
| Tool Result → Runtime Decision                    | Must be normalized                                  |
| Artifact → Stable Repository                      | Must have traceability and valid status             |
| Runtime Action → Governed Action                  | Must consult Governance Engine when required        |
| Deployment Preparation → Deployment Authorization | Must pass governance authorization                  |

### 21.2 Boundary Rules

Subsystems MUST NOT bypass required control boundaries.

A platform implementation that combines subsystems into one deployable component MUST still enforce logical control boundaries.

Control boundary violations MUST be recorded as platform integrity errors.

---

## 22.0 Platform State

This section defines platform state at an architectural level. Detailed state models are defined later, but the platform architecture must identify the state categories that must be preserved.

### 22.1 State Categories

The platform MUST maintain state for:

* specifications
* canonical models
* readiness levels
* construction plans
* execution graphs
* artifacts
* validations
* repairs
* traceability graphs
* governance records
* tool records
* model invocation records
* telemetry and monitoring records
* deployment preparation records

### 22.2 State Rules

Platform state MUST be persistent where required for audit, recovery, traceability, or governance.

Execution state MUST be recoverable after interruption.

Governance and traceability state MUST not be silently overwritten.

State updates affecting readiness, execution, artifacts, or governance MUST be auditable.

---

## 23.0 Security Architecture Requirements

This section defines baseline security requirements for the platform architecture. Detailed security architecture is defined later, but these minimum requirements apply to all conforming platform implementations.

Autonomous construction introduces security risk because the platform processes specifications, invokes models, executes tools, generates artifacts, and interacts with repositories and deployment systems.

### 23.1 Minimum Security Requirements

The platform architecture MUST support:

* identity and access control for users and services
* role-based governance authorization
* controlled model invocation
* controlled tool execution
* sandboxing for generated code execution where applicable
* artifact repository access control
* audit logging
* secret handling restrictions
* network access controls for tool and model integrations
* protection of governance and traceability records
* dependency and supply-chain validation where applicable

### 23.2 Security Boundary Rules

Tools MUST execute through the Tool Integration Layer.

Models MUST be invoked through the model abstraction boundary.

Artifacts MUST enter the repository through controlled interfaces.

Governance records MUST be protected from unauthorized modification.

---

## 24.0 Local-First Architecture Requirement

This section defines the local-first architecture requirement. Local-first operation means the platform can operate without requiring external cloud services, external model providers, or external tool services, provided local equivalents are configured.

Local-first does not prohibit cloud or enterprise integrations. It ensures the platform remains deployable in restricted or privacy-sensitive environments.

### 24.1 Local-First Requirements

A conforming platform SHOULD support local deployment of:

* Specification Engine
* Semantic Model Engine
* Planning Engine
* Agent Orchestrator
* Construction Engine
* Tool Integration Layer
* Traceability Engine
* Governance Engine
* Execution Monitor
* Artifact Repository

A local-first deployment SHOULD support local deterministic tools and local or self-hosted model providers where configured.

### 24.2 Local-First Rules

The platform MUST NOT require external services for core specification validation, planning, traceability, governance, and artifact repository functions unless the deployment profile explicitly declares such dependencies.

External provider usage MUST be configurable and governable.

---

## 25.0 Enterprise Scalability Requirements

This section defines baseline scalability expectations. The platform must support growth from local experiments to team, enterprise, distributed, and hybrid deployments.

The architecture must allow independent scaling of workload-heavy subsystems without changing the core semantic contracts.

### 25.1 Scalable Subsystems

The architecture SHOULD permit independent scaling of:

* Construction Engine workers
* Agent Orchestrator capacity
* model invocation infrastructure
* Tool Integration workers
* Artifact Repository storage
* Traceability query infrastructure
* telemetry and monitoring storage

### 25.2 Scalability Rules

Scaling MUST NOT weaken governance, traceability, validation, or audit requirements.

Distributed execution MUST preserve task state consistency.

Parallel execution MUST respect dependencies and governance constraints.

Multi-project operation MUST isolate specification, artifact, traceability, and governance contexts.

---

## 26.0 Platform Interface Requirements

This section defines required interface categories. The exact API technology is implementation-defined, but the platform must expose interfaces sufficient to support authoring, validation, planning, execution, governance, traceability, artifacts, and monitoring.

### 26.1 Required Interface Categories

A conforming platform SHOULD expose controlled interfaces for:

* specification submission and retrieval
* structural validation
* canonical model retrieval
* readiness evaluation
* construction planning
* execution initiation and monitoring
* artifact repository access
* traceability queries
* governance approvals and audit queries
* tool registry management
* telemetry and operational status

### 26.2 Interface Rules

Platform interfaces MUST enforce access control.

Platform interfaces MUST preserve specification version context.

Governance-controlled actions MUST require governance authorization.

Interfaces that expose artifacts, governance records, or traceability records MUST enforce appropriate permissions.

---

## 27.0 Platform Error Classes

This section defines platform-architecture-level error classes. These errors represent failures in subsystem boundaries, integration behavior, state consistency, and architecture control.

More specific error classes are defined in earlier ISL documents for language, canonical validation, readiness, execution, traceability, planning, tools, and governance.

### 27.1 Platform Error Record Schema

---

## 29.0 Summary

ISL v2.0 defines the ALETHEIA Platform Architecture Model. It establishes the logical subsystems, architectural boundaries, data flows, control points, and conformance expectations required for an implementation of the ALETHEIA autonomous software construction platform.

This revision strengthens the platform architecture by making subsystem responsibilities explicit and by treating governance, traceability, deterministic validation, observability, security, and artifact control as architectural requirements rather than optional implementation details.

A conforming ALETHEIA platform MUST preserve the architecture’s control boundaries even when subsystems are implemented within a single process or service. The platform may vary in technology, deployment topology, and scale, but it MUST remain specification-driven, traceable, governed, observable, and validation-centered.
