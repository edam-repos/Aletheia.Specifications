## 1.0 Scope

This document defines the Platform Security Architecture for the ALETHEIA platform. It specifies the security controls, trust boundaries, identity controls, authorization rules, secret handling, isolation requirements, prompt and context injection defenses, model security, tool security, artifact integrity, audit requirements, monitoring requirements, incident response expectations, and conformance requirements for secure autonomous software construction.

This document applies to all ALETHEIA platform components, including the Specification Engine, Semantic Model Engine, Planning Engine, Runtime Orchestrator, Agent Orchestrator, Model Integration Layer, Tool Integration Layer, Artifact Repository, Traceability Engine, Governance Engine, State Manager, Observability Layer, deployment services, plugins, workers, and extension points.

This document defines:

* security principles
* trust zones and trust boundaries
* identity and access control
* service-to-service security
* project and tenant isolation
* data classification
* secret handling
* context protection
* prompt and context injection controls
* model interaction security
* tool and plugin execution security
* generated-code execution security
* artifact integrity and repository security
* governance security
* audit and evidence security
* telemetry security
* vulnerability management
* incident response
* security testing
* security conformance requirements

---

## 2.0 Purpose

The purpose of the Platform Security Architecture is to ensure that autonomous construction is safe, controlled, auditable, and appropriate for enterprise use. ALETHEIA ingests structured specifications, uses reasoning agents and models, invokes deterministic tools, generates artifacts, executes validation workflows, and prepares deployment assets. Each of these activities introduces security risk.

The security architecture exists to ensure that:

* untrusted specifications cannot control platform behavior
* model prompts and context packages cannot bypass governance or validation
* agents cannot exceed their role authority
* generated artifacts cannot become stable without validation and traceability
* tools and plugins cannot compromise the platform environment
* secrets are never exposed through prompts, logs, telemetry, artifacts, or model context
* project and tenant boundaries are enforced
* security findings affect runtime and lifecycle progression
* audit and governance evidence remains protected
* platform behavior can be investigated after security-relevant events

---

## 3.0 Security Design Principles

### 3.1 Zero Trust for Inputs

All externally supplied input MUST be treated as untrusted until validated. This includes specifications, uploaded files, prior artifacts, model responses, tool outputs, external API responses, repository content, telemetry payloads, and user instructions.

### 3.2 Least Privilege

Users, agents, services, tools, plugins, workers, and model providers MUST receive only the minimum access required to perform their authorized function.

### 3.3 Role-Bounded Autonomy

Autonomous agents MUST operate only within their declared role contracts. No agent MAY approve governance gates, mark validation as passed, promote artifacts, access secrets, or authorize deployment unless a separate specification explicitly grants that authority and governance permits it.

### 3.4 Defense in Depth

Security MUST be enforced at multiple layers: identity, authorization, context control, model protocol, tool sandboxing, repository controls, runtime gates, governance decisions, audit records, and telemetry monitoring.

### 3.5 Deterministic Security Validation

Where security can be checked deterministically, the platform MUST use deterministic tools or policy checks rather than relying only on model reasoning.

### 3.6 Fail Closed

Security control failure MUST default to blocking the affected action unless a governance-approved degraded-mode policy explicitly permits continuation.

### 3.7 Auditability

Security-relevant decisions MUST be recorded. The platform MUST preserve enough evidence to reconstruct who acted, what was evaluated, what was permitted, what was blocked, and why.

---

## 4.0 Security Architecture Overview

The Platform Security Architecture is implemented as a cross-cutting control layer across all platform subsystems.

| Security Control Area    | Primary Enforcement Components                                     |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Identity                 | Identity Provider, Security Module, Governance Engine              |
| Authorization            | Authorization Manager, Governance Engine, Runtime Orchestrator     |
| Context Protection       | Context Controller, Agent Orchestrator, Model Integration Layer    |
| Prompt Injection Defense | Context Controller, Model Interaction Protocol, Security Validator |
| Secret Protection        | Secret Manager Adapter, Runtime, Tool Gateway, Model Gateway       |
| Tool Isolation           | Tool Gateway, Plugin Runtime, Sandbox Manager                      |
| Artifact Integrity       | Artifact Repository, Traceability Engine, Validation Tools         |

| Incident Handling        | Security Finding Manager, Governance Engine, Runtime Orchestrator  |

### 4.1 Architecture Rules

Security controls MUST be enforced before actions occur, not merely reported afterward.

Security checks that affect lifecycle progression MUST create structured records.

Security findings MUST be linked to affected tasks, artifacts, agents, tools, models, contexts, or governance records.

---

## 5.0 Trust Zones

The platform MUST define trust zones to separate responsibilities and exposure.

| Trust Zone                | Description                                                               |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| user-access-zone          | User interfaces, APIs, CLIs, dashboards                                   |
| control-plane-zone        | Governance, scheduling, policy, configuration, orchestration              |
| reasoning-zone            | Agents, context packages, model requests, model responses                 |
| tool-execution-zone       | Tool plugins, compilers, scanners, tests, generated-code execution        |
| artifact-zone             | Artifact content, metadata, packages, repository branches                 |
| state-zone                | Runtime state, memory, checkpoints, recovery records                      |
| audit-zone                | Governance audit records and immutable evidence                           |
| telemetry-zone            | Logs, traces, metrics, alerts, dashboards                                 |
| external-integration-zone | External model providers, tool services, repositories, identity providers |
| sandbox-zone              | Isolated execution for generated code and untrusted tool activity         |

### 5.1 Trust Zone Rules

Data moving between trust zones MUST pass through an approved interface.

External integrations MUST terminate in gateway components or approved adapters.

Sandbox-zone outputs MUST be validated before entering artifact-zone or state-zone.

Audit-zone records MUST be immutable or correction-only.

---

## 6.0 Identity Architecture

Identity controls establish who or what is acting.

### 6.1 Identity Types

| Identity Type              | Description                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| human-user                 | Human interacting with the platform                          |
| service-identity           | Platform service identity                                    |
| worker-identity            | Runtime worker identity                                      |
| agent-identity             | Logical identity for an agent implementation                 |

### 7.1 Authorization Dimensions

Authorization decisions MUST consider:

* identity
* role
* project scope
* tenant scope
* environment
* risk tier
* action type
* target object
* lifecycle phase

### 7.3 Authorization Rules

Authorization MUST be evaluated before governed actions.

Authorization denial MUST block the action.

High and Critical risk systems MUST enforce separation of duties for approval roles.

A user or service MUST NOT gain access to another project or tenant unless cross-scope access is explicitly governed.

---

## 8.0 Project and Tenant Isolation

Shared deployments MUST prevent cross-project and cross-tenant contamination.

### 8.1 Isolation Scope

The platform MUST isolate:

* specifications
* canonical models
* construction plans
* execution graphs
* task queues
* artifacts
* traceability graphs
* governance records
* model context packages
* tool workspaces
* secrets
* telemetry
* evidence packages
* deployment preparation outputs

### 8.2 Isolation Rules

A task from one project MUST NOT read or write another project’s artifacts unless governed cross-project access is explicitly authorized.

A tenant’s context package MUST NOT include another tenant’s data unless cross-tenant access is explicitly authorized.

Telemetry dashboards MUST enforce project and tenant access controls.

Shared workers MUST clean workspaces between tasks.

Shared model and tool providers MUST enforce context and artifact isolation.

---

## 9.0 Data Classification

The platform MUST classify data to determine allowed handling.

### 9.1 Classification Levels

| Classification | Description                                                                                                            |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| public         | Approved for public disclosure                                                                                         |
| internal       | Internal platform or organization information                                                                          |
| confidential   | Sensitive business, architecture, artifact, or operational information                                                 |
| restricted     | Highly sensitive information including secrets, regulated data, tenant-isolated data, or security-critical information |

### 9.2 Classification Rules

Every context package MUST declare sensitivity classification.

Every artifact MUST declare sensitivity classification.

Every telemetry event MUST declare redaction status and retention class.

Restricted data MUST NOT be sent to external model or tool providers unless governance explicitly permits it.

Classification downgrade MUST require governance approval.

---

## 10.0 Secret Management

Secrets require strict handling.

### 10.1 Secret Types

Secrets MAY include:

* model provider credentials
* repository credentials
* tool service credentials
* database credentials
* identity provider credentials
* signing keys
* encryption keys
* deployment credentials
* access tokens
* private keys

### 10.2 Secret Rules

Secrets MUST NOT be embedded in specifications.

Secrets MUST NOT be included in agent prompts or model context unless explicitly authorized by governance.

Secrets MUST NOT be written to logs, telemetry, generated artifacts, test fixtures, or evidence bundles.

Secrets MUST be referenced by secret identifiers rather than secret values.

Secret access MUST be scoped by project, tenant, environment, and service identity.

Secret exposure MUST create a critical security finding and halt or isolate affected execution.

---

## 11.0 Context Protection

Context packages are security-critical because they control what agents and models can see.

### 11.1 Context Control Checks

Before an agent or model receives context, the platform MUST check:

* context purpose
* task relevance
* source object identifiers
* sensitivity classification
* tenant and project scope
* secret presence
* untrusted content markers
* allowed model or provider trust profile
* allowed agent role
* active Construction Boundary
* valid Connection Contexts
* reusable asset sensitivity and provenance
* governance restrictions
* context size and minimization
* redaction requirements

### 11.2 Context Protection Record Schema

| evaluated-by                 | string   | REQUIRED    | Context controller                         |

### 11.3 Context Protection Rules

A context package containing unauthorized secrets MUST be blocked.

A context package containing cross-tenant data without authorization MUST be blocked.

A context package containing untrusted content MUST mark that content explicitly.

Redaction that removes required task context MUST trigger rejection or escalation.

A context package crossing a Construction Boundary without a valid Connection Context MUST be blocked.

Reusable asset context MUST be checked for sensitivity, tenant scope, provenance, license, embedded secrets, and untrusted instruction content before inclusion in model or agent context.

---

## 12.0 Prompt and Context Injection Defense

Prompt injection and context injection occur when untrusted content attempts to override platform instructions, role boundaries, output contracts, governance controls, validation rules, or security policy.

### 12.1 Injection Classes

| Injection Class      | Description                                                                |

| data-exfiltration    | Attempts to reveal restricted context or tenant data                       |
| persistence-abuse    | Attempts to store malicious instructions in artifacts, memory, or metadata |

### 12.2 Sanitization Definition

For ISL, sanitization means applying deterministic transformations or markings to untrusted content before it is used in agent, model, tool, repository, or runtime contexts.

Sanitization MAY include:

* separating untrusted content from platform instructions
* escaping or quoting untrusted text
* removing executable control sequences
* redacting secrets
* replacing restricted values with references
* stripping unauthorized tool commands
* removing unsupported file links or external references

The platform MUST validate that:

* untrusted content is not placed in instruction sections
* untrusted content cannot redefine agent role
* untrusted content cannot change output contract
* untrusted content cannot alter governance decision
* untrusted content cannot declare validation success
* untrusted content cannot request unauthorized tools
* untrusted content cannot access secrets

A critical injection finding MUST block the affected action.

A secret-exfiltration finding MUST block the action and create a security incident record.

A governance-bypass or validation-bypass finding MUST block downstream use.

A sanitized context MUST retain a record of sanitization actions.

An injection finding that cannot be classified MUST escalate.

## 34.0 Security Conformance Requirements

### 34.1 Identity and Authorization Conformance

A platform conforms to identity and authorization requirements if it:

* authenticates users and service identities
* enforces role, project, tenant, environment, action, and risk-tier authorization
* records actor identity for security-relevant actions
* enforces separation of duties where required
* blocks disabled or revoked identities

### 34.2 Context and Prompt Security Conformance

A platform conforms to context and prompt security requirements if it:

* classifies context packages
* scans for secrets
* enforces project and tenant scope
* enforces Construction Boundary and Connection Context scope
* checks reusable asset context before inclusion
* marks untrusted content
* separates untrusted content from platform instructions
* detects prompt and context injection classes
* blocks or sanitizes unsafe context
* records context protection and injection findings

### 34.3 Model Security Conformance

A platform conforms to model security requirements if it:

* invokes models only through the Model Integration Layer
* enforces model trust profiles
* blocks unauthorized restricted context transmission
* normalizes and validates model outputs
* prevents model outputs from bypassing governance, validation, traceability, artifact promotion, or deployment authorization

### 34.4 Tool Security Conformance

A platform conforms to tool security requirements if it:

* invokes only registered tools
* enforces tool trust and isolation profiles
* sandboxes generated-code execution
* records tool security findings
* blocks tool sandbox violations
* prevents tool outputs from bypassing normalization and validation

### 34.5 Artifact and Repository Security Conformance

A platform conforms to artifact and repository security requirements if it:

* controls artifact admission
* enforces metadata and versioning
* prevents failed or quarantined artifacts from promotion
* enforces path controls
* records integrity evidence
* links artifacts to validation and traceability records
* blocks untrusted, unvalidated, or unauthorized reusable assets from promotion or reuse

### 34.6 Governance and Audit Security Conformance

A platform conforms to governance and audit security requirements if it:

* records governance decisions
* preserves immutable or correction-only audit records
* blocks governed actions on audit write failure
* enforces waiver and override rules
* records security-relevant approvals, waivers, overrides, and incidents

### 34.7 Platform Security Conformance

A platform conforms to ISL v3.10 if it:

* defines trust zones
* enforces identity and authorization
* protects secrets
* protects context packages
* protects reusable assets and cross-boundary Connection Contexts
* defends against prompt and context injection
* secures model interactions
* secures tool and plugin execution
* sandboxes generated code
* protects artifacts and repositories
* enforces governance security
* preserves audit evidence
* protects telemetry
* supports vulnerability management
* supports incident response
* tests security controls
* fails closed when security controls cannot be enforced

## 35.0 Summary

ISL v3.10 defines the Platform Security Architecture for ALETHEIA. It establishes the security control layer that protects autonomous software construction across specifications, agents, models, tools, artifacts, repositories, runtime orchestration, governance, telemetry, deployment preparation, and lifecycle evidence.

This revision strengthens the original security architecture by making security mechanisms explicit. It defines trust zones, identity types, authorization dimensions, project and tenant isolation, classification, secret management, context protection, prompt and context injection classes, sanitization rules, validation rules, model security, agent security, tool security, generated-code sandboxing, artifact integrity, repository path controls, governance security, audit security, telemetry security, network security, supply-chain security, security validation, findings, quarantine, incident response, monitoring, vulnerability management, configuration, error classes, testing, and conformance.

A conforming ALETHEIA platform MUST treat security as an active construction control, not an after-the-fact review. Autonomous construction may be fast and generative, but it MUST remain identity-bound, role-bounded, context-controlled, least-privileged, sandboxed, traceable, governed, observable, auditable, and fail-closed.
