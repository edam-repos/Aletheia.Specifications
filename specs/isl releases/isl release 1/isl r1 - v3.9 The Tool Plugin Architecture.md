## 1.0 Scope

This document defines the Tool Plugin Architecture for the ALETHEIA platform. It specifies how deterministic engineering tools are packaged, discovered, registered, described, selected, invoked, isolated, governed, observed, versioned, tested, and retired.

This document applies to all tool plugins used for compilation, build, dependency resolution, testing, static analysis, security scanning, policy checking, infrastructure validation, packaging, deployment preparation, repository operations, formatting, documentation validation, and other deterministic engineering activities.

This document defines:

* tool plugin principles
* plugin package structure
* plugin manifest schema
* tool registry records
* capability declarations
* discovery and registration
* lifecycle states
* invocation request and result contracts
* structured findings
* evidence capture
* execution isolation
* trust profiles
* governance controls
* traceability and telemetry
* versioning and compatibility
* testing and certification
* error classes
* conformance requirements

---

## 2.0 Purpose

The purpose of the Tool Plugin Architecture is to provide a controlled mechanism for integrating deterministic engineering tools into autonomous construction. Reasoning agents may generate, interpret, review, and repair, but generated artifacts MUST be validated by deterministic tools when deterministic validation is applicable.

Tool plugins form the adapter boundary between ALETHEIA and external tools. A plugin translates platform requests into tool-specific execution, then normalizes tool results into structured platform records. This allows ALETHEIA to use compilers, test runners, scanners, formatters, validators, packagers, and deployment systems without hardcoding every tool into the runtime.

The Tool Plugin Architecture exists to ensure that:

* tools are integrated through standard contracts
* tool capabilities are declared explicitly
* the runtime can select tools by capability
* tool execution is isolated and governed
* tool outputs are normalized before platform use
* validation evidence is preserved
* tool activity is traceable to tasks, artifacts, validations, and repairs
* tool failures have defined handling paths
* plugins can evolve without destabilizing platform architecture

---

## 3.0 Tool Plugin Design Principles

### 3.1 Deterministic Validation Boundary

Tool plugins MUST represent deterministic or externally verifiable operations. A tool may produce warnings, findings, reports, or deployment status, but it MUST return structured evidence that the platform can evaluate.

### 3.2 Plugin as Adapter

A plugin MUST act as an adapter between the platform and an underlying tool. The plugin MAY invoke a CLI, library, service, container, API, or script, but the platform-facing contract MUST remain stable and provider-neutral.

### 3.3 Explicit Capability Declaration

A plugin MUST declare its capabilities before it may be selected by the runtime. The platform MUST NOT infer capability from tool name alone.

### 3.4 Structured Results

A plugin MUST return structured results. Raw logs MAY be preserved as evidence, but raw logs MUST NOT be the only output used for runtime decisions.

### 3.5 Isolation by Default

Tool execution SHOULD be isolated from platform control state, unrelated artifacts, secrets, and other project workspaces. Tools that execute generated code MUST run in sandboxed or otherwise restricted environments.

### 3.6 Governance-Aware Execution

Tool use MUST obey governance policy. Restricted tools, external tool services, deployment-affecting tools, destructive tools, and high-risk security tools MAY require approval before invocation.

### 3.7 Traceable and Observable Activity

Every lifecycle-relevant tool invocation MUST be traceable and observable. Tool results that affect validation, repair, artifact promotion, release readiness, deployment preparation, or governance MUST be linked to the relevant task, artifact, validation record, and execution graph.

## 4.0 Tool Plugin Types

Tool plugins are categorized by the operation they expose to ALETHEIA.

| Plugin Type           | Purpose                                                                                        |

| compiler-plugin       | Compiles or builds source artifacts                                                            |
| test-plugin           | Executes automated tests                                                                       |
| analysis-plugin       | Performs static analysis, quality analysis, complexity analysis, or duplication detection      |

| documentation-plugin  | Validates documentation, generated API references, or documentation completeness               |
| format-plugin         | Formats or validates formatting of generated artifacts                                         |
| custom-plugin         | Provides an approved domain-specific deterministic capability                                  |

### 4.1 Plugin Type Rules

A plugin MUST declare one primary plugin type.

A plugin MAY declare secondary capabilities.

A deployment-plugin MUST be governed before production or regulated use.

A security-plugin used for release gates MUST have an active trust profile and validation record.

A degraded plugin MAY be selected only when runtime policy permits it.

Registry updates during active execution MUST trigger impact evaluation when they affect active or planned validations.

---

## 10.0 Discovery and Registration

Tool discovery identifies available plugins. Registration makes them available for runtime selection.

### 10.1 Discovery Sources

The platform MAY discover plugins from:

* configured plugin directories
* service registries
* package registries
* repository manifests
* environment profiles
* enterprise tool catalogs
* deployment manifests
* administrator registration

### 10.2 Registration Process

Registration MUST:

1. locate plugin package
2. read plugin manifest
3. validate manifest schema
4. verify supported platform and ISL versions
5. validate capability declarations
6. validate required isolation profile
7. validate trust profile
8. verify required permissions and secrets references

## 30.0 Conformance Requirements

### 30.1 Tool Plugin Package Conformance

A plugin package conforms to ISL v3.9 if it:

* includes a valid manifest
* declares plugin type
* declares underlying tool and version
* declares capabilities
* declares invocation method
* declares output contracts
* declares isolation and trust profiles
* contains no plaintext secrets
* includes tests or validation evidence

### 30.2 Tool Registry Conformance

A Tool Registry conforms to ISL v3.9 if it:

* stores plugin registry records
* validates manifests
* records plugin lifecycle state
* records capabilities
* records trust and isolation profiles
* records health status
* prevents disabled or revoked plugins from selection
* records registration and lifecycle changes

### 30.3 Tool Invocation Conformance

A tool invocation conforms to ISL v3.9 if it:

* references a selected registered plugin
* declares capability invoked
* declares exact artifact versions when validating artifacts
* declares isolation profile
* declares timeout
* records governance check where required
* returns a structured result
* records findings and evidence where applicable
* emits telemetry
* creates traceability links

### 30.4 Tool Result Conformance

A tool result conforms to ISL v3.9 if it:

* references the invocation
* declares outcome
* records tool and plugin version
* records findings when present
* records evidence references where required
* records affected artifact versions
* declares next action
* does not treat timeout or error as passed

### 30.5 Enterprise Plugin Conformance

An enterprise plugin conforms to ISL v3.9 if it:

* has active trust and isolation profiles
* supports evidence capture
* has health checks
* has compatibility records
* has enterprise certification or validation evidence
* supports governed execution
* emits telemetry
* preserves traceability

### 30.6 Platform Conformance

A platform conforms to ISL v3.9 if it:

* integrates deterministic tools through registered plugins
* selects tools by declared capability
* invokes tools through standard request contracts
* normalizes tool results
* preserves evidence
* enforces isolation and trust profiles
* enforces governance controls
* records traceability
* emits tool telemetry
* handles plugin errors through defined error classes
* prevents unregistered, disabled, revoked, or untrusted tools from lifecycle-critical execution

## 31.0 Summary

ISL v3.9 defines the Tool Plugin Architecture for the ALETHEIA platform. It establishes how deterministic engineering tools are integrated through governed, traceable, isolated, versioned, and observable plugins.

This revision strengthens the original tool plugin concept by defining plugin types, package structure, manifests, capability declarations, registry records, discovery, registration, lifecycle states, selection, invocation requests, invocation results, structured findings, evidence capture, execution isolation, trust profiles, governance controls, traceability, telemetry, health checks, versioning, configuration, testing, certification, extension, error classes, retirement, documentation, and conformance requirements.

A conforming Tool Plugin Architecture MUST make deterministic tools reliable members of the autonomous construction system. Plugins are not arbitrary scripts; they are controlled engineering instruments that validate, inspect, package, and prepare artifacts under explicit capability contracts, isolation boundaries, governance policy, traceability, and evidence requirements.
