## 1.0 Scope

This document defines the Minimal Autonomous Construction System, abbreviated MACS. MACS is the smallest practical ALETHEIA system implementation that can demonstrate autonomous software construction from a structured ISL specification to a validated, stable artifact repository.

This document applies to the first executable reference system built by the ALETHEIA platform. It defines the minimum system target, supported specification domain, required input specification, required generated artifacts, construction task graph, runtime behavior, validation profile, repair behavior, traceability requirements, telemetry requirements, and success criteria for MACS.

This document defines:

* MACS purpose and objectives
* minimal target system scope
* supported ISL subset
* required MACS input specification
* canonical entity requirements
* task graph requirements
* generated artifact requirements
* runtime execution requirements
* deterministic validation requirements
* repair and convergence rules
* artifact repository requirements
* traceability requirements
* telemetry requirements
* success, failure, and escalation criteria
* conformance requirements

---

## 2.0 Purpose of MACS

The purpose of MACS is to prove that the ALETHEIA platform can execute the smallest meaningful autonomous construction cycle. MACS is not intended to prove every future enterprise capability. It is intended to prove that the platform’s core loop works.

The core MACS loop is:

1. read a structured ISL specification
2. normalize it into the canonical semantic model
3. generate a construction task graph
4. execute the task graph through the runtime
5. invoke reasoning agents for generation and repair
6. invoke deterministic tools for validation
7. repair generated artifacts when validation fails
8. promote valid artifacts to stable repository state
9. preserve traceability and evidence

MACS exists to answer one question: can ALETHEIA construct a functioning software artifact from a formal specification without manually writing the final implementation?

---

## 3.0 MACS Design Principles

### 3.1 Minimal but Real

MACS MUST be intentionally small, but it MUST be real. It MUST generate a working software system that can be built and tested with deterministic tools.

MACS MUST NOT be a static demonstration that copies prewritten final outputs and claims autonomous construction.

### 3.2 Specification-First

MACS MUST begin from a versioned ISL specification. The specification is the authoritative source of system intent.

Generated artifacts MUST be traceable to entities in the MACS input specification.

### 3.3 Deterministic Validation Is Required

MACS MUST compile or build the generated system and MUST execute automated tests.

A MACS run MUST NOT be considered successful if build or test validation fails.

### 3.4 Repair Is Required but Bounded

MACS MUST demonstrate the ability to respond to validation failure through repair behavior.

Repair cycles MUST be bounded. MACS MUST NOT permit unlimited repair attempts.

### 3.5 Evidence Is the Definition of Success

MACS success MUST be demonstrated by evidence records: parsed specification, canonical model, construction plan, execution graph, generated artifacts, validation results, repair records if applicable, traceability snapshot, telemetry summary, and completion report.

---

## 4.0 MACS Target System

The default MACS target system is a minimal .NET REST service. The original MACS document identifies the first reference system as a minimal .NET REST service with project structure, endpoint, data model, and tests. 

### 4.1 Default Target

The default MACS target MUST be named:

**MACS Greeting Service**

The generated service MUST expose one HTTP operation that returns a greeting response.

### 4.2 Default Target Behavior

The service MUST satisfy the following behavior:

* accept a name value from the caller
* return a greeting message containing that name
* return a default greeting when no name is provided, if the generated platform chooses to support optional input
* expose at least one deterministic validation test proving expected behavior

### 4.3 Default Target Technology

The default implementation target SHOULD be:

| Field           | Value                               |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| target-platform | .NET                                |
| target-language | C#                                  |
| service-style   | minimal REST API                    |
| test-framework  | xUnit, NUnit, MSTest, or equivalent |
| build-tool      | dotnet CLI or equivalent            |

### 4.4 Equivalent Target Rule

An implementation MAY choose a different language or framework only if the target still provides:

* generated source code
* callable operation
* data model or response object
* automated test artifact
* deterministic build validation
* deterministic test validation
* artifact metadata
* traceability links

---

## 5.0 Supported ISL Subset for MACS

MACS supports a constrained ISL subset sufficient to describe a minimal service application.

### 5.1 Required Entity Types

The MACS input specification MUST include the following canonical entity types.

| Entity Type | Minimum Count | Purpose                           |
| ----------- | ------------: | --------------------------------- |
| Project     |             1 | Identifies the constructed system |
| Context     |             1 | Defines scope and assumptions     |
| Requirement |             1 | Defines expected behavior         |
| Capability  |             1 | Groups functional behavior        |
| Service     |             1 | Defines the service to construct  |
| Interface   |             1 | Defines the callable operation    |
| DataEntity  |             1 | Defines request or response data  |
| Validation  |             1 | Defines acceptance checks         |

### 5.2 Optional Entity Types

The MACS input specification MAY include:

* Actor
* Workflow
* Policy
* Infrastructure
* additional Requirement entities
* additional Interface entities
* additional DataEntity entities
* additional Validation entities

### 5.3 Unsupported Scope

MACS is not required to support:

* multiple services
* asynchronous workflows
* persistence stores
* authentication
* authorization
* message brokers
* infrastructure provisioning
* deployment automation
* multi-tenant behavior
* advanced security policies
* domain-specific integration patterns

Unsupported content MUST be reported as unsupported, ignored with warning, or rejected according to the configured MACS validation profile.

## 6.0 Required MACS Input Specification

This section defines the required input fixture. This is the most important correction to the original v3.3 document: MACS MUST include the actual ISL specification it is expected to construct.

### 6.1 Fixture Location

The reference implementation SHOULD store the MACS input specification at:

`/examples/specifications/macs/macs-greeting-service.isl.md`

If a different path is used, the path MUST be declared in the MACS run configuration.

### 6.2 Fixture Identifier Values

The default MACS input fixture SHOULD use the following identifiers.

| Entity      | Identifier              |
| ----------- | ----------------------- |
| Project     | PRJ-macs-greeting-00001 |
| Context     | CTX-macs-greeting-00001 |

| Capability  | CAP-macs-greeting-00001 |
| Service     | SVC-macs-greeting-00001 |
| Interface   | INT-macs-greeting-00001 |
| DataEntity  | DAT-macs-greeting-00001 |
| Validation  | VAL-macs-greeting-00001 |

### 6.3 Required Fixture Metadata

The fixture MUST declare:

| Field                 | Required Value or Rule                    |

| specification-version | 1.0.0                                     |
| isl-version           | supported ISL version                     |
| name                  | MACS Greeting Service                     |
| owner                 | MACS reference implementation             |
| readiness-target      | Autonomous-Ready                          |
| risk-tier             | Standard                                  |
| target-platform       | .NET unless equivalent target is declared |
| target-language       | C# unless equivalent target is declared   |
| validation-profile    | build-and-test                            |

### 6.4 Required Fixture Content

The fixture MUST define:

* one project named MACS Greeting Service
* one context describing that the service is a minimal PoC target
* one requirement requiring a greeting response
* one capability representing greeting generation
* one service implementing the greeting capability
* one interface exposing a greeting operation
* one data entity representing the greeting response
* one validation requiring build and test success

### 21.3 Recovery Rules

If MACS supports recovery, it MUST validate artifact, state, repository, governance, and traceability consistency before resuming.

If MACS does not support recovery in the first implementation, it MUST declare recovery as unsupported and MUST not claim recovery conformance.

### 26.2 Success Rules

MACS MUST NOT succeed if build validation fails.

MACS MUST NOT succeed if automated tests fail.

MACS MUST NOT succeed if required artifacts are missing.

MACS MUST NOT succeed if stable artifacts lack traceability.

MACS MUST NOT succeed if the evidence bundle is incomplete.

---

## 27.0 MACS Failure and Escalation Criteria

### 27.1 Failure Criteria

MACS MUST fail when:

* input specification cannot be parsed
* canonical model cannot be generated
* required canonical entities are missing
* construction task graph cannot be generated
* execution runtime cannot initialize
* required generation mode is unavailable
* required tools are unavailable
* artifact generation fails
* repository admission fails
* build validation fails after repair exhaustion
* automated tests fail after repair exhaustion
* traceability closure fails
* evidence bundle cannot be produced

### 27.2 Escalation Criteria

MACS MUST escalate when:

* repair reaches iteration limit
* same artifact fails three consecutive repairs
* model output repeatedly violates output contract
* tool result cannot be normalized
* artifact conflict cannot be resolved
* governance blocks execution pending decision
* state consistency cannot be verified

### 27.3 Failure Rules

Every failure MUST produce a structured error record.

A terminal failure MUST produce a completion report with final-outcome failed when possible.

A terminal escalation MUST produce a completion report with final-outcome escalated when possible.

---

## 28.0 MACS Non-Goals

MACS is not required to support:

* production deployment
* container image generation
* cloud infrastructure provisioning
* database persistence
* authentication or authorization
* multi-service architecture
* advanced domain modeling
* distributed workers
* multi-tenant execution
* high availability
* disaster recovery
* complex governance workflows
* full enterprise security scanning
* multiple target languages

These are future platform capabilities. MACS MUST remain focused on proving the first construction loop.

---

## 29.0 MACS Evolution Path

After MACS succeeds, the platform MAY evolve in controlled increments.

### 29.1 Recommended Evolution Sequence

| Increment | New Capability                       |
| --------- | ------------------------------------ |
| MACS-1    | Minimal REST service generation      |
| MACS-2    | Multiple endpoints                   |
| MACS-3    | Multiple data entities               |
| MACS-4    | Input validation and error responses |
| MACS-5    | Basic persistence                    |
| MACS-6    | Security policy validation           |
| MACS-7    | Deployment package preparation       |
| MACS-8    | Multi-service construction           |
| MACS-9    | Enterprise governance profile        |
| MACS-10   | Distributed runtime execution        |

### 29.2 Evolution Rules

Each MACS evolution increment MUST define:

* supported ISL subset expansion
* new generated artifact types
* new validation requirements
* new traceability requirements
* new governance implications
* new success criteria
* regression tests against prior MACS capability

MACS evolution MUST NOT remove the ability to run the original MACS Greeting Service scenario unless formally deprecated.

* produces a canonical model
* produces a construction task graph
* executes the task graph through the runtime
* generates required artifacts
* admits artifacts into repository state
* performs deterministic build and test validation

* no stable artifact is untraced
* repair behavior is demonstrated or validated by failure injection
* completion report references a complete evidence bundle

---

## 31.0 Summary

ISL v3.3 defines the Minimal Autonomous Construction System. MACS is the first named system that ALETHEIA must construct to prove its architecture. It is intentionally small, but it is not symbolic. It must generate a buildable, testable, traceable software artifact from a real ISL input specification.

This revision strengthens the original MACS document by defining the MACS target system, supported ISL subset, required input fixture, normative semantic content, canonical model requirements, task graph, generated artifacts, runtime requirements, agent requirements, model generation modes, deterministic validation, bounded repair, artifact repository behavior, traceability, telemetry, governance, state, evidence, success criteria, failure criteria, evolution path, and conformance requirements.

A conforming MACS implementation MUST prove the first autonomous construction loop: specification to canonical model, canonical model to task graph, task graph to generated artifacts, generated artifacts to deterministic validation, validation failure to bounded repair, valid artifacts to stable repository state, and stable artifacts to traceable evidence.
