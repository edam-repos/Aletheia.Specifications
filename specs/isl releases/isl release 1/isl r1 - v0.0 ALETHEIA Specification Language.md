# ALETHEIA Specification Language (ISL)

# ISL v0.0 — Foundational Standard, System Architecture, and Conformance Framework

**Status:** Normative
**Applies To:** Entire ISL Corpus (v0.0 through v4.0)
**Document Type:** Language Specification Overview

---

# 1. Scope

## Purpose

This section defines the boundaries of the ISL standard and establishes what is governed by this document. The scope is critical because it ensures that all stakeholders—architects, engineers, auditors, and implementers—have a shared understanding of what the specification is intended to control and what lies outside its authority.

This document serves as the **umbrella standard** for the entire ISL corpus. It does not replace lower-level specifications, but instead governs their structure, interaction, and interpretation. It ensures that all ISL components operate as a unified and enforceable system rather than a collection of independent documents.

## Definition

This document defines:

* the purpose and positioning of ISL
* the structure and layering of the ISL corpus (v0.0–v4.0)
* the normative interpretation model
* the conformance framework across all layers
* cross-layer contracts and system integrity rules
* alignment requirements with external standards

This document SHALL be treated as the **authoritative governing specification** for all ISL-compliant systems.

---

# 2. Normative References

## Purpose

Normative references define external standards that ISL depends on or aligns with. In enterprise and regulatory environments, standards do not exist in isolation; they must integrate with established frameworks for quality, security, traceability, and observability.

This section ensures that ISL can be mapped into existing compliance ecosystems. It also prevents duplication of widely accepted standards by explicitly requiring alignment rather than reinvention.

## References

The following standards SHALL be supported by ISL-compliant implementations:

* ISO/IEC 25010 — Systems and software quality models
* NIST SP 800-53 — Security and privacy controls
* W3C PROV-DM — Provenance data model
* OpenTelemetry Specification — Observability and telemetry

Implementations MUST provide traceable mappings where applicable.

---

# 3. Terms and Definitions

## Purpose

This section establishes a controlled vocabulary for ISL. Formal systems require unambiguous terminology so that all participants—human and machine—interpret concepts consistently. Without standardized definitions, traceability, governance, and validation become unreliable.

The definitions here are intentionally minimal and foundational. More specialized terms are expected to be defined in lower-layer documents.

## Definitions

**Specification**
A structured, machine-interpretable definition of a system expressed in ISL.

**Artifact**
A generated output including code, configuration, tests, or infrastructure.

**Construction**
The process of transforming specifications into validated artifacts.

**Deterministic Validation**
Validation performed by tools that produce repeatable and verifiable results.

**Traceability**
The enforced linkage between specifications, tasks, artifacts, and validation outcomes.

**Conformance**
The degree to which an implementation satisfies ISL requirements.

**ISL Corpus**
The complete set of ISL documents spanning v0.0 through v4.0.

# 4. Symbols and Abbreviated Terms

## Purpose

This section provides commonly used abbreviations to improve readability and consistency across the ISL corpus. While not normative in behavior, these definitions prevent ambiguity in interpretation.

## Terms

* ISL — ALETHEIA Specification Language
* SDLC — Software Development Lifecycle
* NFR — Non-Functional Requirement

---

# 5. Conventions

## 5.1 Normative Language

### Purpose

Normative language defines how requirements are interpreted and enforced. This section is critical because it transforms ISL from descriptive documentation into an enforceable standard. Every MUST, SHOULD, and MAY directly impacts implementation behavior and compliance validation.

### Definitions

* **MUST / SHALL** — mandatory requirement
* **MUST NOT / SHALL NOT** — mandatory prohibition
* **SHOULD** — recommended; deviations MUST be justified
* **MAY** — permitted

All normative statements are enforceable unless explicitly stated otherwise.

# 6. Overview of ISL

## 6.1 General

### Purpose

This section introduces ISL as a system rather than a single document. It provides a conceptual understanding of how ISL transforms software development into a specification-driven, autonomous process.

The goal is to align readers on the paradigm shift: software is no longer manually constructed but systematically generated from formal specifications.

### Description

ISL defines a **formal specification and execution contract system** for autonomous software construction.

ISL enables systems to be:

* specified in machine-interpretable form
* transformed into construction workflows
* executed through orchestrated agents and tools
* validated deterministically
* governed through enforceable policies

---

## 6.2 System Model

### Purpose

This subsection defines the major components of the ISL system and how they interact. It establishes the conceptual model that underpins all lower-level specifications.

### Model

ISL defines a closed system consisting of:

* specification definition
* semantic normalization
* construction planning
* execution and orchestration
* deterministic validation
* repair and convergence
* governance enforcement

All components SHALL operate as an integrated system.

---

# 7. Architecture of the ISL Corpus

## 7.1 Layered Structure

### Purpose

This subsection introduces the layered architecture of ISL. The layering is essential for scalability, maintainability, and clarity. It ensures that different concerns (language, runtime, execution, ecosystem) are separated but coordinated.

### Structure

| Layer                | Versions | Responsibility                           |
| -------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Foundation Layer** | v0.x     | Standard, conformance, system definition |
| **Language Layer**   | v1.x     | Specification structure and semantics    |
| **Platform Layer**   | v2.x     | Runtime architecture, state, tools       |
| **Execution Layer**  | v3.x     | Orchestration, pipelines, SDLC           |
| **Ecosystem Layer**  | v4.x     | Vision, adoption, evolution              |

---

## 7.2 Layer Responsibilities

### Purpose

This subsection explains what each layer is responsible for, preventing overlap and ambiguity. It ensures that implementers understand where functionality belongs and how responsibilities are distributed.

---

### 7.2.1 Foundation Layer (v0.x)

Defines the governing standard, conformance model, and system integrity rules.

---

### 7.2.2 Language Layer (v1.x)

Defines:

* specification structure
* canonical semantic model
* readiness gating
* traceability
* planning model
* tool integration model
* governance model

---

### 7.2.3 Platform Layer (v2.x)

Defines:

* platform architecture

---

# 8. Cross-Layer Contracts

## Purpose

This section defines the rules governing interactions between layers. Without these contracts, the layered architecture would degrade into loosely coupled documents with inconsistent behavior.

Cross-layer contracts ensure that the system behaves as a **coherent, enforceable whole**.

## Contracts

* v2.x MUST implement v1.x semantics
* v3.x MUST operate using v2.x runtime models
* v3.x MUST enforce v1.x constraints
* v4.x MUST NOT violate lower-layer guarantees

---

# 9. System Integrity Rules

## Purpose

This section defines invariant rules that must always hold true across the system. These rules protect the integrity of the autonomous construction process and prevent unsafe or invalid execution.

## Rules

* Construction MUST NOT begin without readiness validation
* Artifacts MUST NOT be accepted without deterministic validation
* All system elements MUST be traceable
* Execution MUST operate under governance constraints
* No layer MAY bypass another layer’s responsibilities

---

# 10. Principles

## Purpose

Principles guide design decisions and implementation strategies. They provide philosophical constraints that ensure consistency across the system.

## Principles

* Specification Authority
* Deterministic Validation
* Traceability Enforcement
* Governed Execution
* Separation of Concerns

---

# 11. Conformance
